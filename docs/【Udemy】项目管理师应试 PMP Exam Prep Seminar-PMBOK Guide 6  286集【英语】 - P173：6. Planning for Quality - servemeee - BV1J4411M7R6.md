We need to plan for quality。Our first process of the three is to plan quality management。

 to plan quality management means we'll create a quality management plan。

 like our other knowledge areas。 This is a subsidiary plan That's part of the overall project management plan。

 and it defines how will we do the other processes in this knowledge area。 So basically。

 it defines how will we manage quality and how will we control quality。

 Let's take a look at plan quality management。 So it defines the quality policy for the project。

 defines our Q A requirements and defines quality control or control quality。

 What are those activities like。

The quality planning process is an iterative activity that happens throughout the project remember planning is iterative you come back to it whenever it's needed。

There's a PMI theme you should know for your exam， I plan， I implement， then I measure， I react。

 and I document outcomes， so plan， implement， measure， Re， and document。

If the product what we create is not acceptable， then the project isn't done。 We have poor quality。

 We have to make it acceptable。 We have to meet requirements in order to be successful。

 all the way back to Chaer 4， the pinmbaok。 when we created our charter。 We had success criteria。

 That's why we need success criteria。 That's why we need clear requirements。

 We don't want fuzzy requirements because then we get to the end of the project and the customer inspects it in scope validation。

 And they say， well， this isn't what I wanted。 And you had a misunderstanding。 We have poor quality。

 we have an issue now， we have to resolve。The scope must be met in order to achieve quality that those two are dependent on each other。

 so the scope has to be created to achieve quality and in order to have quality。

 you have to meet scope， which means I have to have clear requirements。

Let's look at the Es for plan quality management， our inputs， the project charter。

 the project management plan。The requirements management plan。

 the stakeholder engagement plan and the scope baseline， several project documents。

 the assumption log， requirements documentation， requirements traceability matrix。

 the risk register and the stakeholder registerister， and of course， we have EEF and OPA。

Lots of tools and techniques here for planning， quality， expert judgment， benchmarking。

Data analysis and data analysis， we have cost benefits analysis and the cost of quality。

 couple of new terms here。Decision making， there's that multi criteria decision analysis。

Data representation， flow charts， logical data model， a matrix diagram， mind mapping。

 and then we will plan out our testing and inspection， and of course we have meetings。

The outputs of planning quality。 We get the quality management plan。 That's the big output here。

 but we also have quality metrics。 You might have updates to the project management plan。

 specifically the risk management plan and the scope baseline。Our project document updates。

 the lessons learned register， the RTM， the risk register and the stakeholder register that those are all outputs of plan quality。

We really need to think about the five key inputs for planning quality， very important。First off。

 the project charter， the charter， remember， gives us the high level project description。

 It also tells us how do you know if this project is successful。

 So what are the measurable outcomes to determine success。

The project management plan is needed because it has that integration management that what I do in quality affects the rest of my project。

 So you think about the requirements management plan and this risk management plan。

 The stakeholder management plan and the scope baseline。

 Let's talk about the risk management plan for a second。 This is Chapter 11 in the Pembaok guide。

 The risk management plan is needed， because what risk may have a negative effect on quality。

 So what risk threaten the ability to hit those success criteria。

 And if we have a risk happens that will threaten our quality， then we have to plan accordingly。

 So we haven't really talked about risk yet。 It's coming up in a few sections。

 but it's important with quality planning。The project documents for planning， the assumption log。

 remember， it's really assumptions and constraints， So assumptions。

 if they prove to be not true or they prove to be false， that can affect quality。

The requirements documentation， of course， because that's what we're trying to meet in order to have quality。

 we have our RTM because remember it traces the requirement through all of our phases。

The risk register tied to the risk management plan。

 and then the stakeholder register because we want that collaborative relationship with our stakeholders。

And then we have enterprise environmental factors and OPA。

I know I kind of breeze over those sometimes， but it's important to acknowledge these especially for quality because we're talking about regulations。

 rules， standards， what about the geographic makeup of the project， where resources are。

 where the project work is taking place， that can affect quality。The organizational structure。

 marketplace conditions。 What about the working conditions out in the field or in a dangerous environment that can affect quality。

 And there could be some cultural perceptions that affect quality。

With OPA we're talking about templates， check sheets。

 so I have a activity to install 1 thousand fixtures。

 I have a check sheet to do it correctly every time and historical information。

 if I've done this type of work before， can I take that work and adapt it to the current project。

 so historical information can be used for planning quality。All right， great job。

 you're making great progress， keep moving forward， I have confidence you can do this。
