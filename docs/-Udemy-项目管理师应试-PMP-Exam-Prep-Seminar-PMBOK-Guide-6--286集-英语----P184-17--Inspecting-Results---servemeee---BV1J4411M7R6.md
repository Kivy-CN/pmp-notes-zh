你。The number one way to control quality to do this process is through inspection that you or your project team or a third party has to go out and inspect the results of what you've created。

 We're inspecting the results of what was created because we want to keep mistakes out of the customer's hands。

 We don't want the customer to see those mistakes。 So we have to go out and do a review or a product review。

 you might call it an audit or a walk through。 but you're really inspecting。

 you're making certain that it's of quality that what you're creating is going to work and operate that the way the customer expects。

 So you're confirming that you have a conformance to a requirement and that what you're creating is fit for use。

 So inspecting the results。When we inspect results。

 it's an opportunity to do gate data gathering and to have some analysis of that data。

A checklist is a great way to ensure the work is done the same way each time。 I for repetitive task。

 You have 1000 fixtures to install step 1， step 2， step 3。

 and the team member checks those off as they do those activities。

 So you might have 10 different people installing these different fixtures。

 But if everyone follows the checklist， it'll be done the same way each time。

A check sheet is a little bit different than a checklist。

 A check sheet helps organize data when you have a quality issue。

 so you might also know this as a tally sheet so imagine that you're manufacturing cars。

 you could have a check sheet where you go out and you do a little tally of any car that has a scratch。

 any car that the windows aren't rolled up all the way。

 Any car that has a defect or a deing on the body of the car so you have a little tally it's all the different issues。

 but how many of each issue so you can tally up the defects。

 So a check sheet do the same work over and over。 see I messed it up。

A checklist is when you do the work over and over and over， a check sheet is a tally sheet。

 it's the tally up the number and the type of defects。Okay， good job。

 I'll see you in the next lecture。
