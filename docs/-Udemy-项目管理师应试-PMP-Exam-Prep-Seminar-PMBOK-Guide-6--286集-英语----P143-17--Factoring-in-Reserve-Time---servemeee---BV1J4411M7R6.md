嗯。There's a term you need to know for your exam and it's a contingency reserve and a management reserve。

 they're very similar。Contingency Reser is usually associated with money。

 and it's for risk events that disrupt the project。

Management reserve is typically associated with time or money。

Management reserve is for when activities take longer than what was planned， you have a pool of time。

And this is where the or money part comes in， or money because you have to pay for the laborer that's doing that time。

It accounts for schedule uncertainty。So the estimated duration。We've accomplished that。

 we've looked at all of our work packages， we have an estimated duration for the activities。

In risk analysis in risk identification and that we do risk analysis， qualitative and quantitative。

 we'll also have an understanding of not just how much a risk event will cost us。

 but what's the disruption in our project how long so we have an estimated duration also for our risk events that are in the project and you'll see that some of our risk have a low probability at a low impact and we might accept those and so those risks that are accepted。

 those could cause a disruption if they happen。The contingency reserve。

 this is associated with the known unknowns， you know there are going to be some activities that are late。

 you know there are going to be some activities that have a risk that happens。

 but you don't know which one it's impossible to predict the future， so we have known unknowns。

The reserve analysis。What we're doing here is that let's say we take a percentage of our project。

 Our project is going to last 60 days。Plus or minus 10%。

 so we have 60 days for the work and then 10% we have a6 day buffer that we make up as the reserve for management reserve。

If an activity is late。Our project doesn't extend because our project duration isn't 60 days。

 our project duration is 66 days in this example， so it extends now from 60 to 62 now we only have four days left。

The earlier in the project that I start having activities that are late， that's a real warning。

 that's a risk that my project is going to eat all of the management reserve。

So the reserve analysis is how much time have I set back or how much money do I have set back and if we start having mistakes stake。

 then my contingency in my management reserve begins to get depleted and that's going to affect my project duration overall。

Over time， the contingency reserve or the management reserve might diminish。

 so what happens here with a contingency reserve？Is it's for risk， so we have X amount of dollars。

 let's say we have $100，000 in our contingency reserve。The closer we get to the end of the project。

 the fewer and fewer risk we're likely to have so that $100。

000 pool may also diminish not to be spent in the project。

 but return to the organization to the portfolio to now go spend elsewhere。

 so if we can get by some key big risk events， we don't need all that money sitting there in our reserve so that money can be reduced or even eliminated because we've gotten by these big risk events。

So contingency， this is part of the scheduled documentation。

 it hits the reserve for overruns on time， so we have our management reserve and then our contingency reserve is for risk events that can disrupt time。

 but it's typically associated with money。Considering management reserve。

 this is a specific amount of amount of funds in the project budget， so yes。

 it's in the project budget， but it's withheld for control purposes it doesn't mean we get to spend it。

 it's for time overruns or risk events。The reserve is for unforeseen work that's within the scope of the project。

we're talking about unknown unknowns， so risk events we didn't even see coming can be paid for。

 if you will， with this contingency reserve。Now it's not included as part of the schedule baseline。

 it's not part of the schedule baseline， but it is part of the overall project duration。

 so the schedule baseline in our example might be 60 days。

 but we have this buffer at the end of six days that's our management reserve。

Contracts may require some management reserve as a change to the schedule baseline so on our contract we have a contract to the vendor。

 they're going to use management reserve， they get all 66 days is what's being said here that they don't only have to fit to 60。

 they're going to get all6 days because that affects their pay。

 they have to pay for that labor so they want all the time and have to be accounted for that time。

So management Reser and contingency Reer know those terms for your exam。

 we'll see contingency reserve coming up when we get to chapterpt 11 in the Pimbaok Guide on Ri。
