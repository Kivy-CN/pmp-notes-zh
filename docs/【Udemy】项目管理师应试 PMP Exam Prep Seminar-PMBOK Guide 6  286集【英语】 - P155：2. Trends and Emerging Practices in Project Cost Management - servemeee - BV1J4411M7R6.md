。When it comes to some trends and emerging practices in cost management。

 there are a few things that you may have to account for in your role as the project manager and you should be familiar with for your PMI exam。

The first is the cost of the resource， we have to consider the full cost of the resource。

 so a resource being not just materials but also people。

 but think about if you have to ship things or insurance or people are traveling that that all contributes to the cost to your project so the whole cost of the resources needed to complete activities。

You might also have a recurring cost so you think about anything that you use on a regular basis or a monthly service fee you pay or a subscription to a website。

 so any of the things that you have that are supporting your project that happens through the duration of the project that has to be accounted for。

This is not the same thing as life cycle costing， but you may be asked to predict life cycle costing。

Lifecycle costing is how much will it cost to maintain the thing that your project creates you've seen life cyclee costing if you ever buy an appliance there's the big yellow sticker on it like a water heater will tell you how much you can expect to pay to have this water heater per year in your home that's lifecycle costing so you create a piece of software what's the TCO。

 the total cost of ownership for this thing that you're creating for your customer。

Some considerations in cost management first off is when is the cost incurred so when does it count actually in your project。

 so for some people as soon as the decision is made that we're going to procure these resources。

 it's as if that money is depleted from their budget。

Others it only counts once the order is placed and then you might have it happens when the item is delivered or what I prefer is when it's actually paid out of the budget。

 but your organization may have different approaches to how you account for costs being incurred so you need to know that because that can affect your budget if you have a very big capital expense and as soon as the decisions made those funds are depleted from your budget it might look like there's a cost variance。

 but reality it's the decision made to purchase those items。

You might also in a longer project have to calculate and consider things like interest。

 the return on investment， the discounted cash flow， like the time value of money。

And then the payback analysis， the payback period。Cost management will also allow you do some tailoring。

 the tailoring though is going to be subject to what are your governance。

 what's the rules for tailoring in your organization。So knowledge management。

 I need some formal knowledge management about our financial approach， our financial database。

Estimating and budgeting when it comes to tailoring。

 there are lots of different approaches for cost estimating and budgeting so what are the policies i'd have to hear to in my organization。

Ened value management willll look at EVM in this section so EVM you don't have to do all the formulas。

 maybe you just want to do a few of the formulas for your exam though you'll need to know all of the formulas in an agile approach there's different approaches for cost estimating in the agile methodologies you might have a few questions on agile and cost I don't think you're going to see an overwhelming amount of questions on agile and cost estimating for this exam。

And then of course the governance， what's the rules， the enterprise and environmental factors。

 do you have to participate in auditing of where the moneyies were actually spent。

 so that's something that happens with tailoring cost management that'll be unique to your organization。

 your discipline。All right， great job， keep moving forward。
