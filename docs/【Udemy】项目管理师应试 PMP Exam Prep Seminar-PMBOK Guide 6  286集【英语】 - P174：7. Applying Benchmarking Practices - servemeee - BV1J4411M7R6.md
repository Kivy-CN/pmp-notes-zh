We've seen benchmarking several times as a tool and technique benchmarkching is an opportunity to compare one thing to a similar thing so I could compare SQL and Oracle。

 I could compare a senior engineer to a junior engineer。

 I can compare different materials and how they may work best in our project。

When it comes to quality， though。It's all about measuring one item against the other and how does that most accurately and precisely deliver quality。

 So what's the best choice for our project。We can also do a measurements against other projects。

 so we have a similar project and how is it performing we should be able to perform as well in this current project。

Benchmarking the goal is to evaluate the differences between projects。

In chapterpt 7 in the Pembaok we talked about earned value management。

So I could take two projects in two different disciplines， healthcare and IT or manufacturing。

 or even all three of them， and I could benchmark those based on earned value management。

 I could see what's the CPI for each one what's the cost variance for each one and I would have an idea of which one's performing best。

This helps me take corrective actions for my current project so I can benchmark before and after we make an adjustment。

I can create some false goals， though， when I benchmark and also create some internal competition。

 So inside the company， if we're comparing projects。

 then we have to be very accurate in our reporting， because if。

Bob over there is telling us that his project's at 0。99 CPI and we're at 0。95， but in reality。

 he's at 0。91， then our project looks like it's not performing as well as Bob。

 so let's emulate Bob's project when really Bob's projectss not doing so hot。

 so truth and reporting is mandatory when we're benchmarking two different projects。

Benchmarking just to be clear， I'm comparing two different systems， I'm comparing technologies。

 materials or projects。 you can also use benchmarking to test the materials for what material is best suited for your project。

All right， that's benchmarking。
