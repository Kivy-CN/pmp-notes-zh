In the last lecture we talked about negotiating for resources。

 so when we go to negotiate for resources， some things that we have to know going into that negotiation。

 what's their availability so we want to work with functional managers to determine when people can work on your team。

What are the costs you think about the costs， assuming that you have to account for the direct cost a direct cost means that the cost of that labor is attributed to your project budget Many project managers have an indirect cost where the labor is not an expense to the project it's an expense for the organization so it's outside of the project。

And then what's their ability， their competency and proficiency？Some other factors to consider。

 what about their experience with this technology or the type of work you're doing？

What knowledge and skills do they bring So remember we have that explicit and tacit knowledge where explicit is very easy directions where tacit is more shaped by experience。

What's their attitude， you want people excited to work on your project。

And then international factors， you're dealing with people from all over the world and different cultures and time zones and even languages that can affect your project team and communication。

Some challenges for resource negotiation， so you're talking with managers。

 you have to think about your org structure， so are you allowed to go talk to those managers or do you have to flow through your manager to get resources in another group？

What's functional manager's role as far as your structure。

 remember those matrix structures and who has the authority？

What about other project managers that will use that resource so again in a matrix structure an individual might be on several projects at once。

 so you may have to coordinate with other project managers when you'll be utilizing that resource。

And then operational schedules， when will the work take place。

 and then when are those individuals allowed to work on your project because they may have regular day to day assignments they have to do too。

You do not want unnecessary project team roles， you only want people on your team when they can be utilized。

 you don't want people sitting idle on your team， people on your team they need to be working if you don't have assignments for them at this time then you you've got a problem because someone's paying for that person to be idle and that's pretty boring for the individual as well and their attitude is going to tank。

All right， so those are all some considerations for resource negotiation。🎼Yeah。
