Welcome to the PMP Blitz Review this is a mini cram session， if you will。

 of everything that we've talked about throughout this course it's jammed packed but I don't linger I mean we move really fast through this section so I'm warning you now。

So the PMT Blitz review， we're going to talk about the initiating group planning， executing。

 monitoring controlling and closing all the way back to the beginning of the course then I'm going to hit the headlines from the nine knowledge areas that we're going to look at integration management scope management schedule management Co quality resources communications。

 risk procurement and stakeholder I'm going to walk through the memory cards that I've mentioned throughout this course and then I have an assignment for you and it's a big one but a valuable one where you're going to map out all of the EOs it's not fun I'm going to tell you now but it's really important it's everything that we've talked about in the course so it's an opportunity to complete that activity and to really have a refresher of all that we've discussed so let's hop in here to the Blitz review and knock it out right now。
