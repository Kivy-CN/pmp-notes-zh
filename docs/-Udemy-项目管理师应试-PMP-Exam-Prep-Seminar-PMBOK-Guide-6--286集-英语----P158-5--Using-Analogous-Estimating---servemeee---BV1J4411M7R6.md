You've already seen analogous estimating that we saw this in schedule。

Analogous estimating is an estimating approach where we take historical information。

 And then from that， we predict how long or how much the project is going to cost。

 I have to have really good historical information。

 If the historical information is flawed or hasn't been updated to reflect what actually happened。

 Then I'm going to have a poor cost estimate。This is a form of expert judgment because it's based on what past past experiences and they've been updated。

It's less time to complete an analogous estimate， and it's also less accurate than other estimating approaches。

Let's look at an example of an analogous estimate。So here's this park project and in this park project they created a sidewalk around this pond and then they calculated out that it was $25。

287 to complete Well there's a new project here， this King project very similar。

 it's 4500 feet by six feet。So they used an analogous estimate based on this difference in the square footage。

 and then they predicted that the Carleton Park is 100 the Carlleton Park was 25287。

 and this King Park is slightly larger or considerably larger。 So it will be 108500。

 So you can see theres some flaws and some risk here between the two just because。

You have the same type of material and about the same square footage it might not really always work out that way。

 there may be more curves， there may be more work to create the path where the paving is going but it's a real quick estimate so analogous is not very reliable but it's fast and so this is an analogous estimate based on historical information I can predict the future or the current cost of this project but not always very reliable。
