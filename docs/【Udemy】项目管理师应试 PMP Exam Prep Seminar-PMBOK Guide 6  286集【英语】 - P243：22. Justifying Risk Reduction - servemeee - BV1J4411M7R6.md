。At the end of the last lecture， we talk about justifying risk reduction。

 but there may be times when it's better to spend money just to get rid of the risk than to allow that risk to be lurking in the project。

So justifying risk reduction is the examination of the cost to eliminate the risk altogether in proportion to the probability。

 the impact and the risk score。 So you may have instances where if we could get rid of this one risk based on like sensitivity analysis。

 what's the impact of this one risk， that would really help the entire project be more successful。

 if we wouldn't have that risk， you know， hovering over the project， So justifying risk reduction。

 typically， though you need more time or more money to do it。

 you have to justify why youd need more time and more money。

And then is the solution worth the trade offs， You know。

 if there's only a 10% chance of it happening， that's a pretty low probability。

 That means there's a 90% chance that it won't happen。

 But if you're right in that 45 and greater as far as percentages go。

 then maybe you start thinking about this is worthwhile。

 the spend our way out of this with the assumption。

That I can spin my way out of this that the probability and impact assessment is valid。

 so we really want to study that before we go with that argument and have some good proof as to why we should spend our way to avoid or mitigate the risk event。

So what we're talking about here is the cost of prevention or lowering the risk of it actually happening。

 so we're talking about probability and impact， how do we lower that or avoid it。

So what's the cost to prevent it versus the cost of just responding to the risk。

 we look at that ratio， it would be to prevent it would be $10，000 to respond to it would be $60。

000 so maybe that's a pretty good decision but if it's going to be 50。

000 to prevent it and respond to it 60 then I have to think about well what are the odds of it really happening those are pretty close there maybe be better to save that 50 and basically hedge my bets it's not going to happen than to spend the 50 and then we could have gotten by it。

What happens if the eliminated cost savings so if the risk doesn't happen and let's look at that again。

 if a risk is not eliminated， so what's the cost savings if the risk doesn't happen All right。

 so that was a mouthful there basically what we're saying here is。If I have to spend 60。

000 to make this risk go away and I say， no， I'm not going to do that。

 I'm going to gamble basically the risk won't happen。 so now I have a cost savings。

 the risk didn't happen， and I saved this 60000 over here。

 but the opposite if the risk does happen and I didn't pay for it。

 how much is that going to cost me how painful will that be。

So cost is inherent also in the project delay， so we're talking about just money here。

But we also think about that a risk could have a delay in our project schedule。

 so you might be paying for that labor or a penalty or fine or having to give up a bonus。

 so there's other costs that may be there when the most apparent cost is just the time delay。

 there could still be other factors here。I have to use some good judgment here。

 so I need some subject matter experts， some analysis of budget and time to figure this stuff out about solving the risk。

 do I want to reduce the impact or probability and how much would that cost me so this takes a little bit of time to do but it's worth doing especially for those significant risk events or risk that are early in your project this is typically something that we want to do。

All right， good job， I'll see you in the next lecture。
