Back in project schedule management we talked about using a bottom up estimate where we start at zero。

 we start the leaf package in the work breakdown structure and we account for every component in the WBS and this creates a sum for the project that is a bottom up estimate that you start at zero and your work your way up。

Bottoms up it means we're starting at the bottom and accounting for all the cost in our WBS so it's usually something that was associated with cost just like I said。

 but you could do it with time al right so it's used for resource estimating and used for how long these activities will take you have to have a work breakdown structure to do a bottom up estimate so you have to know exactly the type of resources and exactly what that work package is going to create so you're accounting for the time in this instance later we'll see it works for cost as well。

Some factors here with bottom up estimating you do this with the project team。

 this typically isn't a solo activity that you have the project team involved because they are the experts。

But it's one of the most time consuming methods because I have to identify every work package in the WBS。

 It's more expensive because of all the time involved to create it。But it's the most accurate。

The benefit of creating this bottom up estimate is it helps the project team members buy in and have synergy and a sense of ownership because they see the cost and if you use this for time。

 they see the cost and the time and the value of each activity that they'll be building each work package they're building in the project。

So that's bottom up estimating for cost。
