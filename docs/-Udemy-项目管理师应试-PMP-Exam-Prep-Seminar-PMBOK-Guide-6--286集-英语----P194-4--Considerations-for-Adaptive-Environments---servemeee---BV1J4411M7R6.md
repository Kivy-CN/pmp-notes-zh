üéºYeah„ÄÇIn an adaptive environmentÔºå we're dealing with selfled teams where the project manager is not directing and managing the work„ÄÇ

 but individuals are focusing on getting the work done and having a collaboration working with one another„ÄÇ

 Se organizing teams use this concept of generalizing specialist„ÄÇ

 So it seems like a contradiction in terms there„ÄÇ But the idea is that individuals don't do just one role that they can do many different roles and contribute many different ways on the project team„ÄÇ

In an adaptive environmentÔºå we want collaboration and collaboration can boost productivity because with generalizing specialists„ÄÇ

 we collaborate on task to get work done fasterÔºå that it's not isolated and you do your tiny piece and then someone else takes over as you work together to get the whole requirement created„ÄÇ

Adappttive teams also encourage problem solving that we facilitate problem solving„ÄÇ

Some other considerations for adaptive teams that we want an integration of distinct work activities„ÄÇ

 this is just a really fancy way of saying you encourage people to work together on problems„ÄÇ

 to work together on activities that it's not isolated and I only do this one thing that we can all work together and all contribute to the deliverable„ÄÇ

Adaptive teams openly communicate with one another„ÄÇTypically co-located in one spot„ÄÇ

 very easy to turn around and ask questions of one another so that helps with knowledge sharing and then we want to have some flexibility in our work assignments because anyone can contribute to the work if there's a skills gap then we need some coaching or training but we have a flexibility here on who contributes to the project work that we can all contribute we're generalizing specialist„ÄÇ

Collaboration is so important in all projectsÔºå but it's the very nature of an adaptive team„ÄÇ

 Collaborative teams are what we want in an adaptive environment„ÄÇ They work well with one another„ÄÇ

 They openly communicate They're used to variety in the work and they can adapt to change„ÄÇ

 There's less time and an adaptive team because we are time bound„ÄÇ we have that two to four weeks„ÄÇ

 typically for an iteration And so we don't have time for decision making that is drawn out or centralized tasking where in a predictive environment„ÄÇ

 we assign task to people in an adaptive environment„ÄÇ

 The team decides who do what and when and what needs to be done next„ÄÇ

Resource management and an adaptive environment also has some considerations„ÄÇ

It's less predictable in an adaptive environmentÔºå so when resources are available can affect a predictive environment in an adaptive environment„ÄÇ

 it's less predictable about when we need particular resources„ÄÇ

 adaptive environments more knowledge drivenÔºå like software development versus construction where we need the materials to do the construction„ÄÇ

In an adaptive environmentÔºå thoughÔºå we have to have agreements in place for fast supply„ÄÇ

 so we're not waiting on resources that they're available when we need them„ÄÇ

Lean methods are critical for controlling cost and schedule„ÄÇ

 so we operate in a lean fashion that as the work comes in„ÄÇ

 we attack the work collaboratively and we want to get things done„ÄÇ

 that we aren't waiting for decisions or waiting for materials„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 so those are some consideration considerations to know with human resources and physical resources in an adaptive environment„ÄÇ
