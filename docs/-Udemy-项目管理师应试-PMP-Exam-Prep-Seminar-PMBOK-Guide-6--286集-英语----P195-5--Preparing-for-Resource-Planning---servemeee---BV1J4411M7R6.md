Let's talk about planning resource management this is chapter 9 of the Pimbach and our first process here is to really dig in and to create a resource management plan so we're talking about physical resources a human resources so we begin by identifying our project needs what roles do we need on the project we need a software developer。

 we need a tester we need an instructional rid， a designer so what are the roles that we have to have in our team。

Who do those people report to in the organization， So what's the reporting structure。

 And then we begin to assign roles and responsibilities。

 A role is just a generic name like a software developer。

 The  responsibility describes the type of work they'll do what they are responsible for the decisions that they'll make how they do the work。

 So that's all part of your responsibility as a team member。Acquiring physical resources。

 so our human resource plan。There is no human resource plan。

 our resource management plan addresses physical resources as well。

 so how do you get physical resources onto your project and when they needed it？

Influence for planning resource management。 we talked about this earlier。

 the environment and the politics。 What about our communication。

 our organizational change management comes into play again， Our culture and organization issues。

 what's happening in the organization and then virtual teams and where they locate it。

 So just a little reminder as we go into planning that the things that can affect the team cohesiveness can also affect how we plan to manage our team。

Some resource terminology， all right， so a role is just that generic project team name like I just mentioned。

 the authority level is your decision making ability。

 so what are you allowed to make decisions on not just you the project manager but also the individuals。

 the project team members。Responi are the actions and the expectations to complete an assignment。

The competency is basically the depth of skill， how competent an individual is in a particular programming language or competent in structure or competent in a piece of software。

 that that affects their ability to do the work quickly and accurately。

Let's look at the EOs to plan resource management。We have the project Charer。

 the project management plan， specifically we're looking at the quality management plan。

 scope baseline， project documents， the schedule， your requirements， the risk register。

 the stakeholder register， and then we have EEF and OPA。Tools and techniques， expert judgment。

Data representation， so hierarchical charts you can create a hierarchy of your team or an org chart。

Responsibility assignment matrixtri。Text oriented。 so you have just a list。

 so it's not a visualization。And then we have some organizational theory and we'll talk about that coming up。

 and then of course， meetings。Our outputs will be the resource management plan。A team charter。

 a new term， and we'll see this in detail coming up。 So we have a team charter。

 and then project document updates such as the assumption log。

An org chart is just a way to show who reports to whom so that could be the project manager up there at the top and then you have different team leads at the next level down and then you have individual team members that's all that org chart is it shows the organization and the structure and the reporting structure of the people on your team。

A matrix chart is a table that shows the intersection of an activity and a role or a team member。

 The one that we're looking at in this chart is a Racy chart Racy means that you are responsible。

 accountable， you're consulted or informed about that activity。

There can only be one person accountable， there could be multiple people responsible。

 but only one person is accountable。A responsibility assignment matrix is similar to a RA C。

 but what a RA does instead of using the RAI， it could use a different legend so it could use you implement。

 that would be an I， it could be that you report on this so that could be an R。

 it could be that you are in participants see it could be a P。

 so you could make up your own legend in a RA， it could also just be a checkmark for who's doing that activity。

 doesn't have to be overly complex。Another matrix chart is a roles and responsibilities chart。

 It's very similar to a Ram。 The difference is instead of the team member names。

 it would be the role on the project。 So you would have developer one developer2。

 you might have a designer， the instructional designer。 you might have the tester。

 and then you might have the transition。 So that would describe the roles I just made those up who knows what the roles are in your discipline。

 And then you could do a check mark or have your own legend and anyone who's a developer could attack one of the activities that are assigned to the developers。

 So it's just using a generic role instead of Sam and Sheey and Ben and so on。

 So those are some different charts you should be familiar with。All right， so that was our inputs。

Tools and techniques and outputs for our human resource management plan keep moving forward。
