üéº„ÄÇNow that our project's in motion and people are outdo activities and they're coming to status meetings and they're reporting on deliverables that they have created„ÄÇ

 we're managing the project team as a project manager this means you're tracking team member performance„ÄÇ

 you're giving feedback to individualsÔºå you're managing changes in the team as new people come on the team where people leave your team and you're influencing team behavior you're also working to resolve conflict„ÄÇ

Let's look at the Es for managing the team„ÄÇThe inputsÔºå your project management plan„ÄÇ

 your resource management planÔºå the project documents like the Iue logÔºå Leson learned registerister„ÄÇ

 your team assignmentsÔºå and the team Charter„ÄÇYour work performance reportsÔºå member of data„ÄÇ

 informationÔºå and now reports the assessment of the teamÔºå and then EEF and OPA„ÄÇ

 and we'll talk about OPA in a moment„ÄÇSome tools and techniques here for managing your team„ÄÇ

 your interpersonal and team skills„ÄÇConflict managementÔºå decision making„ÄÇ

 emotional intelligence and leadershipÔºå and your PMIS„ÄÇThe outputs of managing the team„ÄÇ

Things like a change request could happen from managing your team Upates to your plan„ÄÇ

 updatesates to the resource management planÔºå the schedule baseline and the cost baseline Project document updates like your issue log and lessons learned„ÄÇ

 and you may have updates to E E F„ÄÇI mentioned that we have some particulars here with OPA that we want to utilize when it comes to managing the team„ÄÇ

 so things like certificates of appreciationÔºå very easyÔºå very low budget„ÄÇ

 but it's a way to show some recognition and to manage the team„ÄÇ

Putting people's names and newsletters or on a project website is good remember those bonus structures and corporate apparel that that's part of managing the team that you continue to do team development even as part of managing the team you want people to get work done„ÄÇ

Conflict management is naturalÔºå people are going to conflict with one another„ÄÇ

 so when you have a team issue that's a disruption of the work„ÄÇ

 you have people that aren't getting along or working well together„ÄÇ

 so it may not be your position as the project manager to resolve this conflict„ÄÇ

You may have to promote it or escalate it to a different manager for your examÔºå though„ÄÇ

 you'll want to know that openness resolves conflict„ÄÇ Our goal is to focus on issues„ÄÇ

 not personalities„ÄÇ We want to focus what's happening here in the present„ÄÇ

 not what's happened in the past„ÄÇManaging conflict also includes„ÄÇ

The understanding of how important is this conflict„ÄÇ

 Sometimes people are out in petty conflicts that have nothing to do with the goals of the project„ÄÇ

 So while we don't necessarily ignore thoseÔºå they're kind of pettyÔºå they're pretty small„ÄÇ

What about a time pressure for conflict resolution do we need a quick resolution or do we do we need to draw this out and really get to the root cause and really understand why people aren't getting along together so what's the time pressureÔºü

What about the position of the people involvedÔºå the senior employee versus a new junior employeeÔºü

What about motivation to resolve the conflictÔºå short term or long term gets back to that idea of time pressureÔºü

WellÔºå we need to know some terms when it comes to solving conflicts and solving problems„ÄÇ

The first one is the preferred approach to conflict resolution and that's to have a collaborative problem solving approach a collaborative problem solving approach means that you and I work together we don't really care who's right or wrong„ÄÇ

 We just want the best outcome for the project and it's more open and friendly and we understand each other's position„ÄÇ

Forcing or directing means the people or the person with the power„ÄÇ

 the authority will make the decision we're going to do it this way because I'm the senior engineer„ÄÇ

SoÔºå that's forcing„ÄÇCompromising or reconciling it sounds good„ÄÇ

 but it's really a lose lose compromising means that both people have to give up something so an example would be a stakeholder wants you to add things to the project but they don't want to pay for it and you don't want to add things to the project at all unless they pay for it and give you more time„ÄÇ

So while you're adverse to changeÔºå you agreed to take it on but there's a penalty„ÄÇ

 there's a fee and a time factor for that change request„ÄÇ

 so both people had to give up something and neither party got 100% of what they wanted„ÄÇ

 so it's considered a loseÔºå lose„ÄÇWithdraw or avoiding is where one person leaves the argument or they avoid the argument„ÄÇ

 a lot of times you see withdrawal is where someone will say fineÔºå just do whatever you want„ÄÇ

 I don't care„ÄÇ and they leave the argument So that's considered a yield lose smoothing or accommodating is where we downplay the differences often when there's a petty„ÄÇ

 short conflict that we really don't need to spend a lot of time on so you could smooth it out„ÄÇ

 come on guysÔºå we know this isn't important„ÄÇ This isn't what we're here to do let's just go about getting our work done and not worry about these types of problems so you kind of downplay the issue„ÄÇ

Interpersonal skills that we have to haveÔºå leadershipÔºå obviously talking about aligningÔºå motivating„ÄÇ

 directingÔºå inspiringÔºå influencingÔºå thoughÔºå we're talking about being persuasive and almost like a sales to influence of why we want work done a certain way or to sell people on getting their activities done on time„ÄÇ

This includes active and effective listening„ÄÇActive listening means I'm involved in the conversation„ÄÇ

 I'm picking up on nonverbal cluesÔºå and I paraphrase what you've said and repeat it to confirm understanding„ÄÇ

Effective listening is where I really understand the motivation behind the question or the conversation that often there's an underlying reason or intent in what's being communicated„ÄÇ

I'm aware of the project team and how they interact with one another„ÄÇ

 and that might be creating some issues or there may already be issues on a team„ÄÇ

I also want to maintain trustÔºå so if someone tells me something in confidence„ÄÇ

 I keep it in confidence„ÄÇSo I maintain trust while managing the teamt„ÄÇ

When it comes to managing the teamÔºå I need to have effective decision making„ÄÇ

 so I want to always focus on project goalsÔºå that's the whole point of project management to get stuff done„ÄÇ

I want to follow a logicalÔºå methodical decision making process„ÄÇ

I want to look at my environmental factorsÔºå what are the policies„ÄÇ

 the rules and the governance that I have to operate within as the project manager„ÄÇ

I analyze the informationÔºå dataÔºå informationÔºå so that allows me to make good decisions„ÄÇ

I want to consider the personal qualities and develop those qualities of project team members when I make decisions„ÄÇ

I want to make decisions that keep people involved and stimulate team creativity like brainstorming and mind mapping and that fists ofify voting that we saw earlier„ÄÇ

When I make decisions I have to consider riskÔºå will my decision introduce new risk to the projectÔºü

And as a project managerÔºå I have to be approachable„ÄÇ

 I have to have an attitude and an openness that people can approach me with questions or concerns that we can address„ÄÇ

There are some management styles that you should be familiar withÔºå autocratic„ÄÇ

 the PM makes all the decisions„ÄÇDemocraticÔºå the project team is involved with the decisions„ÄÇ

 They may often vote on the decision„ÄÇ Laez fairair is a project manager is hands off„ÄÇ

 The team makes all the decisions„ÄÇ It sounds niceÔºå it sounds like self LED teams„ÄÇ

 but sometimes we need the project manager to make a decision„ÄÇ

 And if the project manager has this Laezfa attitude„ÄÇ they aren't available„ÄÇ

 And then it seems like there are delays or the project manager's head is in the sand„ÄÇ

 something we obviously don't want„ÄÇAnd then exceptionalÔºå exceptional always sounds great„ÄÇ Really„ÄÇ

 it's called exceptional because you're doing management by exception„ÄÇ

 It's where you reward the top 10% and punish the bottom 10%„ÄÇ

 and everybody in the middle is kind of in the slush there„ÄÇ

 So exceptional is you're an exception to everyone else„ÄÇ Good or bad„ÄÇ

 You ever have a manager that always seems like it's somebody's turn to be in trouble„ÄÇ

 That's management by exception„ÄÇüòäÔºåThere are five project management powers you need to know„ÄÇ

You're an expert means you're experienced in that discipline or technology„ÄÇ

 or you've been doing project management for so longÔºå you're considered an expert PM„ÄÇ

Reward is where the team believes you have the power to reward them for their work„ÄÇ

Formal is you are only a positional that you are a new project manager in a company„ÄÇ

 so there's no real relationshipÔºå there's just the relationship of the position„ÄÇ

 a project manager and the position of the project team„ÄÇ

Coercive is where the project team feels threatened that you could punish them or give them a bad assessment„ÄÇ

And then refer it is where the team has worked with you before„ÄÇ

 so they have a relationship with you alreadyÔºå or the project manager says„ÄÇ

 we're going to do it this way because JaneÔºå the CEO put me in charge and that's how we're going to do it so you refer to someone else's authority„ÄÇ
