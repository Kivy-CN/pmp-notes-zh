Welcome to this section on Project Communations。We have an awful lot to talk about here when it comes to communication because 90% of a project manager's time is spent communicating。

 so it's no wonder that this is a really important topic for your PM&P exam in this section we're going to discuss the project communications management overview and creating a project communications plan and so this is tied a lot to what we'll see coming up in stakeholder management because we're communicating with stakeholders。
