，Our first process in the cost management knowledge area is to plan cost management we need to create a cost management plan so this is the subsidiary plan of the overall project management plan and it addresses three other cost management processes it will define how will you estimate cost how will the budget be managed and then how will you control cost let's check out the EOs for plan cost management it's pretty straightforward I need the project charter。

 the PM plan in particular the schedule management plan and the risk management plan and then EEF and OPA。

Three tools and techniques， expert judgment， data analysis and meetings。

 and then the only output of planning cost management is to create the cost management plan。

Some considerations for planning cost management。 I need the schedule management plan because I need to understand the processes and the controls that will affect my cost estimating approach。

 I need the risk management plan because risk will affect my cost estimate and my cost management because remember。

 risk， as we'll see in Cha 11， risk can have a factor on time and it can have a factor now in this section on cost。

And then enterprise environmental factors， just all of the rules in the structure and how I interact and how I get things done。

The market condition， if you're on an international project。

 you might have to worry about the currency exchange rates。

 if you have a commercial database for doing cost estimating。

 that's something that's unique to your organization like X amount of dollars per square foot。

And then what's the productivity like in different locales， so you think about geographical concerns。

 there may be some productivity differences based on the different parts of the world where your project's going to take place。

Let's check out the cost management plan The cost management plan basically defines how you estimate。

 how you budget and how you control， but there are some other things that are established in the cost management plan that you should be aware of what's the unit of measure are you in US dollars are you in euro are you in yen。

 what's the measure for your finances that you'll be spending in this budget。

What's the level of precision？So how precise do you have to be when it comes to predicting and controlling like you might have that range of variances or plus or minus 5%？

The level of accuracy。Organizational procedure links， so how do you procure？

Here how do you tie this back to the scope and requirements What are your control thresholds if you have a variance greater than $5000。

 you have to do a variance report， for example。What's the cost estimating approach， so analogous。

 parametric，3 point， how did you create these estimates？

What are the rules for performance measurement？ So how do you measure。

 how do you know if you're doing well on cost The ones that we are going to look at in this section will be earned value management and then reporting formats。

 do you have a status report， Do you do a variance report or an exceptions report。

 So how do you communicate performance when it comes to cost。

 These are all questions that are answered in the cost management plan。Great job。

 I'll see you in the next lecture。🎼。
