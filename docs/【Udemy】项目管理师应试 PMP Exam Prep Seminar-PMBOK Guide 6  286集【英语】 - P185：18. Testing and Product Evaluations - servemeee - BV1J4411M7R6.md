üéº„ÄÇüéºWe know that control quality is all about inspection„ÄÇ

 Let's talk a little bit more about some approaches to inspect„ÄÇ In particular„ÄÇ

 we want to see testing and product evaluation„ÄÇ So testing is where we are testing the product against our quality standards„ÄÇ

 Does it meet our standards for qualityÔºå which if it does„ÄÇ

 It means it's acceptable that the customer should sign off on it in scope validation„ÄÇ

Testing and product evaluations though is unique to your discipline„ÄÇ

 what you test and what you evaluate in your discipline is probably different than ITE or healthcare or manufacturing or whatever project an individual is working in„ÄÇ

In software developmentÔºå we want to find bugs and errorss in construction„ÄÇ

 we might be looking for electrical and plumbing at HVAC issues„ÄÇ

 and then we do this throughout the projectÔºå not just at the endÔºå but as we create things„ÄÇ

 We do testing and product evaluation„ÄÇ It's real tempting to do this right before you do scope validation„ÄÇ

 but that can be costly might be a quick fix early onÔºå a costly fix later„ÄÇ

 because other things may be built upon that error„ÄÇStatistical sampling„ÄÇ

 I mentioned this earlier back when we talked about managing quality„ÄÇ

 Staistical sampling we go out and we do a random selection„ÄÇ So from our pool of deliverables„ÄÇ

 we choose4 or five items„ÄÇ and or maybe 20 or 30 items is more appropriate„ÄÇ And so from that„ÄÇ

 the number of defects we find and that small sampling is a reflection of what it's going to look like in the whole population„ÄÇ

 SoÔºå for exampleÔºå if we had a project to install 1000 doors„ÄÇ new doors throughout an office building„ÄÇ

 We might go visit 200 doors and inspect how it was installed„ÄÇ And out of those 200„ÄÇ

 if we find 20 doors that were incorrectly installedÔºå we might say out of 1000„ÄÇ

 then we could expect100 doors to be installed incorrectly„ÄÇ

 So that's an idea of statistical sampling a very simple exampleÔºå I know„ÄÇ

 But statistical sampling is the small sampling is a reflection of the pool as a whole„ÄÇ

Now let's talk about a cause and effect chart we've seen cause and effect a couple of times„ÄÇ

 This shows the relationship between the variables in a process and how you have causal factors contribute to poor quality„ÄÇ

 That's the effect„ÄÇ The effect is the problem of the poor quality„ÄÇ

 so it will help us organize our processesÔºå help us facilitate the conversation with the team„ÄÇ

So to create this diagramÔºå we're going to look at in a moment„ÄÇ

We start out with the effect the problemÔºå and then we begin to branch off of that with possible causes„ÄÇ

 This is also known as an Ihiikawa diagram or a fishbone diagram„ÄÇ So let's look at one„ÄÇ

This is a cause and effect chart„ÄÇ noticeice the effect there in green„ÄÇ That's the problem„ÄÇ

 And then see how it looks like a fishbone„ÄÇ We begin to branch off with these big causes„ÄÇ

 And then off of those causesÔºå we can even get more granular and have contributing causes„ÄÇ

 So it doesn't solve the problem„ÄÇ but it facilitates the conversation with the team„ÄÇ

 It helps us do root cause analysis„ÄÇ So know this as a cause and effect chart„ÄÇ

Also known as a fishbone chart or an Ihiikawa chartÔºå all the same thing„ÄÇAll rightÔºå good job„ÄÇ

 I'll see you in the next lecture„ÄÇ
