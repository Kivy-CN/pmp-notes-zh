Agile release planning is something that we do in an adaptive environment it's where we are creating a high level summary of when we expect the product to be released。

 so we're creating a schedule for our release typicallyy every three to six months is what we're aiming for here。

We're creating a roadmap and a vision， and we'll look at that in a moment。

It helps also to determine the number of iterations or sprints that well do in that three to six month period。

And then how much needs to be developed in order to have a deliverable of value。

 so what's our increment， what's our deliverable at the end of our three to six months。

And then how long will it really take to have a releasable product？

So let's look at our product vision and release planning here。

So at the top we have the product vision， the vision of the product is really what's driving the roadmap。

 so yours is going to look totally different than this， of course， if you're in agile or adaptive。

So you can see we have the first release there。In our first release， we have all of our iterations。

 so iteration1 or zero if you subscribe to that， like setting things up。

 but iteration zero all the way to iteration in， however many iterations you can get done in three to six months。

So that's our release plan of when we expect to have a iteration and when will that begin to create our deliverables and you can see we have different releases。

 this is for the first release than the second and the third across the top there。

Our release plan feeds into our iteration plan， so each iteration remember is like two to four weeks。

 we do iterations of activities， and that's where we begin to schedule our development based on the user stories。

 and then that helps us create our tasks， the activities that we'll do in that iteration。

So if you start at the bottom and you see like tasks D12 hours， all of those tasks。

 those different hours are contributing to one user storyor。

And then we have user story two and three and so on， remember user story is a requirement here。

So all of those packaged up feed into iteration one。So in our release plan。

 the sum of X amount of iterations will equate to the first release， so this is a decomposition。

 if you will， of when will you have a release， what does it take to get to the release so it all adheres to the product vision release planning is when will the thing be released。

Great job。 Keep moving forward。 We're almost done with this section。 I know it's a lot of material。

 You're doing great。 We're almost done here with this section。 Keep pressing forward。😊。
