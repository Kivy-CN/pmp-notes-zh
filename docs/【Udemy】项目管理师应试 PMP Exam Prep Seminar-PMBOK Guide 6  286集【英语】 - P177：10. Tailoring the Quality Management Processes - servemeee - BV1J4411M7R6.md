🎼。We can tailor the quality management processes so based on the project priority based on the rules in your organization。

 you can tailor quality， you can tailor quality planning。

 managing quality and controlling quality but first we have to think about what existing quality policies do I have to adhere to I can't tailor my way around those quality policies。

 those are part of enterprise environmental factors so I have to do those policies I have to adhere to them。

Part of OPA and to some extent EEF， you may have some quality tools and techniques and existing templates that you have to use and so those are things that I can't tailor out of the project what we're talking about what tailoring is to what depth do I need quality planning to what depth will we do managing quality process to what depth will we do quality control or controlling quality as it's called in the Pimbat。

Some things to consider here， What about standards and regulatory compliance， Can I tailor those。

 standards， yes， usually regulatory， no， you have to adhere to regulations。

 regulations are requirements， so what quality standards exist in your discipline in your application area that you're allowed to tailor that would help your project run more smoothly and then are there any specific regulations。

 laws or legal requirements in your discipline that you must adhere to you is no shortcut around those that regulations are requirements。

 you can't tailor those。Continuous improvement though is how will quality be managed。

 so all the processes， the 49 processes， how will quality be managed and can you execute those processes。

 can you do those processes with quality and can you tailor those processes at all。

Is it managed at the organizational level so like a PMO or can each project tailor your processes。

 so you have to know the rules when it comes to how quality is managed or expected to be managed in your organization。

Stakeholder engagement is also important when it comes to quality。

If we think about the big picture here。The stakeholders， the customer of the project。

 they're the most important person in the project。 The stakeholders set the requirements。

 So the requirements are for the stakeholders， for the deliverable。

So we want a quality product to meet requirements to satisfy stakeholders we talk about quality。

 we're talking about conforming to requirements and requirements came from our stakeholders so we want this collaborative environment with our stakeholders and also with our suppliers so collaboration is really important and that fits into tailoring to what depth will you do stakeholder engagement。

We'll see stakeholder engagement in much more detail in chapter 13 of the pembaok with stakeholder management。

All right， good job， keep moving forward。
