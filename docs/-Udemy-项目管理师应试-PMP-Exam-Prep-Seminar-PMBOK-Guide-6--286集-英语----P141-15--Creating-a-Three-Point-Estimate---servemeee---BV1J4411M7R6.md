嗯。Another estimating approach that you can use is a three point estimate。

 and there are a couple variations of this you'll need to know for your exam。

A three point estimate is where we find the average of the optimistic。

 the most likely and the pessimistic。This approach to three point estimating is called a triangular distribution because we have a triangle of optimistic。

 most likely and pessimistic。 So there you go it's triangle。 So in this example。

 if we had an optimistic estimate of 25 hours。Or most likely 45 or pessimistic， the worst case is 75。

 so we took 25 plus 45 plus 75。If then divide by three， it would be 48。3 the hours。

So that's what we would predict how long that activity would take。

Another approach is a perRT technique， it's also a three point estimate。

 and this is called beta distribution， so it's a little different。

PerRT means program evaluation and review technique， but we just call it pert。

What pert does is's weighted towards the most likely where the triangular。

 it was just an average Pert has a little little weight or weighted factor for most likely。

 So what we're doing here， we take optimistic。Plus four times the most likely， plus pessimistic。

 divided by 6， and that will equal our estimate。So we'll take the same case here， 25， 45 and 75。

So we take four times 45。Plus 25 plus 75 and whatever that comes out to be。

 we divide by 6 and then we would say it's 46。66 hours， we're weighted。

 meaning that we're putting more belief in the most likely time。

 so this is called a beta distribution， it's a beta of our it's factored towards the middle it a beta distribution。

Three point estimates， you might also see them abbreviated like this on your exam。

 don't let it worry you don't let it throw you， where most likely might be a T in an M optimistic a T in an O and pessimistic a T at a P and then a three point estimate。

 a T a lower uppercase E and then you can see the little T there preceding all of our factors。

 the T just means time。So a little hint。You can also do this with cost。 So instead of a T。

 you might see a little C there。 and so the C would be it's a cost with the 3 point estimate。

 and we'll see that in chapter 7。Let's compare and contrast here。Alright。

 so we have an optimistic of 40 hours， most likely 55， pessimistic of 70。

 so what happens if we do it with pert and what will happen if we do it with our three point estimate so what will the results be so let's take a look at our formulas。

So our total for the  three point estimate， if we take 40 plus 55 plus 90 is 185， divided by 361。67。

 that's our average amount of time， that's what we would predict。If we use pert。

 it's 40 plus 55 plus 90 and you can see our formula 40 plus 4 times 55 plus 90 divided by 6。

 so you sum those up divide by6 and the answer would be 58。

3 so what's happening here is with a three point it's just the average。

 so if you have a very negative pessimistic or a really aggressive optimistic estimate。

 it will skew your average in pert everything is skewed if you will or weighted towards most likely so you have to have a lot of confidence in your most likely estimate。

You do this for every single activity to do three point or per。

The reality is you could take just some of your activities and do this， but for your exam。

 it's used through the whole project。So that's perRT and three point estimate。

 so know how to do those， you're probably going to have to do that math on your exam。🎼All right。

 keep moving forward， I'll see you in the next lecture。
