。Once we have created our network diagram and we know the critical path that tells us the earliest we could finish the project。

We might be。Challened， let's say by management or stakeholders to， well， can't you get done faster。

 Can you compress the schedule， So we have developed the schedule， We have our milestone charts。

 We have our bar charts。 We have evidence of why the projects going to take so long。

 You can look at our network diagram right and see this is the flow of the work。

 But customers will often say， well I really need it done faster。 So I can't necessarily work faster。

 but are there some things I can do to try to compress the overall duration。

 and there are two terms that deal with schedule compression。

Crashing means you add more people Imagine they're crashing into each other so you crash the project。

 you add labor to get done faster Cring， though increases cost Crashing is also prone to the law of diminishing returns。

 You can't just keep adding people and adding people and adding people to get done in five minutes right work takes some amount of time to do and we're just going to get in each other's way if you add too many people So crashing。

 you pay for the labor it increases cost。Fast tracking is where you take phases or activities。

 but typically phases and you allow entire phases to overlap。

So fast tracking is increasing the risk have you ever seen like a football stadium being built？

So over here it's all mud and dirt and still in construction， but on the other side of the field。

 they already have the bleachers going up into the stands。

 so that is fast tracking you have two phases that are overlapped because it's such a huge project。

Fast tracking though increases risk because if we discover an error based on an earlier phase。

 it could affect that phase that's overlapping， so it increases risks。

 you have to be much more cautious when we do fast tracking。

Now let's talk about resource leveling heuristics。Resource leveling heuristics means we have a rule。

 a heuristic about how many hours a resource can be utilized in a time period。

 and typically we're talking about people like 40 hours max。So this little bar chart， this histogram。

Each different color you see there represents the amount of hours one of our project team members they're working this week。

So you can see that bright green one and that blue one and the turquoise one and so on。

 they're well above our max are heuristic of 40 hours， so we have to level that we say no。

 you can only work 40 hours max so all that extra time then gets put on to next week so they're limited they're capped at 40 hours where they could get all this work done this week in five days but because we've limited it at to 40 hours are schedule is likely to increase because we can't do as much effort in five days of duration the effort' still the same it's still the same amount of labor it's just not compressed。

 it's going to take longer so this is resource leveling you have a heuristic。

There's a similar term called resource smoothing resource smoothing is where we keep the 40 hour max。

But it only applies to activities that are not on the critical path。

 so we do smoothing on those activities that have floated because we take advantage of that time to increase their overall duration。

Those activities that are on the critical path would generally allow people to work more time if we're doing smoothing。

 our goal is to adhere to the deadline in our project。So leveling everybody regardless 40 hours。

 smoothing everybody regardless， except for if you're on a critical path activity。

So know those terms for your exam， leveling and smoothing， keep going， you're doing great。

 I'll see you in the next lecture。
