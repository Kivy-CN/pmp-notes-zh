As a project manager you know how important it is to communicate with your stakeholders communications is one of the most important things that we do as a project manager„ÄÇ

 so let's talk about some key concepts for project communications management„ÄÇ

There are different ways that we can communicateÔºå obviously verbal and face to face is the prepared method for communication„ÄÇ

 but think about written versus spoken communication and when is one preferable over the other or one is one most appropriate„ÄÇ

Think about formal and informal communicationÔºå so those hallway meetings and ad hoc meetings versus a report or a presentation„ÄÇ

Your body language and the tone affect your message and in the mediaÔºå so is it a formal report„ÄÇ

 is it an emailÔºå is it a text messageÔºå what's most appropriateÔºü

And then your choice of words can affect the meaning or the intent of your message„ÄÇ

 so those are some key concepts you're one thing that I really want to come back to this idea of informal communications sometimes you well you ever send an email and you put a little joke in and then people don't get the joke„ÄÇ

So your choice of words and what you're communicatingÔºå we have to be careful that we're clear„ÄÇ

 I'm not saying don't be friendly and have a jokeÔºå but that we're clear„ÄÇ

 use a little smiley face or you know those remoteote icons or whatever they're called where you're just letting people know wink wink it's a joke because it's easy to misinterpret and then especially with written communications„ÄÇ

 what the body language and tone isÔºå so face to face is always the preferred method of communications„ÄÇ

Look at these communication activities and the way that we communicateÔºå obviously internal„ÄÇ

 but what about external communications where you have to communicate with the media or the public and is that even what you do as a project manager„ÄÇ

 maybe external that handled by a communications department or a spokesperson for your organization„ÄÇ

What about formal versus informalÔºå There's something about putting things in writing that makes it more formal that makes it more official„ÄÇ

 except for emailÔºå which is more informal or a text message so what we're communicating should fit the media so how it's being delivered so we want to be aware of that when we think about what are we communicating and is this the best method and does this make the stakeholder expectations for communication„ÄÇ

We think about the hierarchyÔºå who communicates to whom„ÄÇ

 thinking about managers and stakeholder representativesÔºå your project team„ÄÇ

 and just other people that you have to communicate„ÄÇ

 what's the hierarchy because that can affect how you communicate„ÄÇOfficial communications„ÄÇ

 whether it's reports or presentations are more formal and then unofficial like text messages and emails that may be more relaxed in the tone and of course„ÄÇ

 written and oral written always seems to have a more formal approach to it as more serious approach„ÄÇ

 especially when it's one of our work performance reports oral can be good though because we can be direct but it's always good to follow up like you're in the meeting with your project team and someone gives you a verbal commitment to doing an activity It's good to write that down and follow up and get it in writing right after the meeting because you know what's going to happen I don't remember doing that So it just helps people remember what they promise„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåWithin communicationÔºå there are five Cs„ÄÇThe letter CÔºå not like the ocean„ÄÇ

 There are five Cs of communication„ÄÇ You need correct grammar and spelling„ÄÇ

 Sometimes you have the spell the wrong word or you spell something incorrectly„ÄÇ

 or you have poor grammar„ÄÇ It's a distraction from the message„ÄÇ The message is most important„ÄÇ

You want to have concise expression and avoid excessive wordsÔºå so excessive words„ÄÇ

 things that are sorous or„ÄÇToo many too fancy„ÄÇ See it it's easier to say that„ÄÇ Ex words„ÄÇ

 that just affects the message that you don't want to say megalopolis when the word city will do„ÄÇ

 you want to be concise and direct„ÄÇ You want to have clear purpose„ÄÇ Why am I getting this report„ÄÇ

 Why am I getting this email„ÄÇ So it's clear It's direct„ÄÇ It's concise„ÄÇ

 People are busy and want to be able to skim it„ÄÇ and then go to the bullets„ÄÇ

 go to an executive summaryÔºå so want to be concise and have a clear purpose„ÄÇ

 I need a coherent and logical flow of ideas„ÄÇ So you don't bury the lead as we say in journalism classes„ÄÇ

 you get to the point„ÄÇ You put the most important stuff at the top„ÄÇ

 you make information easy to find„ÄÇ you're not writing war and peace when you create a novel„ÄÇ

 You are going to the point„ÄÇ And then you put stuff in bullets and use heading so people can skim and find what they're interested in„ÄÇ

 And then color coding is good too„ÄÇ not a bunch of colors and clip art„ÄÇ But I meanÔºå you could„ÄÇ

A little box up there that's red amber greeneen to show the level of importance so these are in your reports and you want a controlled flow of ideas so just what I'm talking about there about being coherent and then you a controlled flow of ideas so most important to least important so those are the five Cs of communication„ÄÇ
