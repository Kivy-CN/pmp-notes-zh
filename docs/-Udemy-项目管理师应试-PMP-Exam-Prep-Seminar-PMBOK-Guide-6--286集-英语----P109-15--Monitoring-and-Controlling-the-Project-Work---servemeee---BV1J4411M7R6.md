üéº„ÄÇProject integration managements pretty bigÔºå isn't it So we've talked about initiatingÔºå planning„ÄÇ

 executing now we're moving into monitoring and controlling and this is our next process to monitor and control the project work Mon and controlling is an iterative activity that we're doing this throughout the project it's going to happen all the way throughout is all about the project manager having control over the project team and lot of times we we'll see it kind of disguise as you're monitoring something you're managing something but what we're really doing is ensuring that what's happening and execution is what should be happening in execution based on the project plan So planning and execution obviously go together but we also have kind of this umbrella here of monitoring and controlling that execution had better match what was planned and if not we need to respond to it„ÄÇ

Let's look at the EO for monitoring and controlling the project„ÄÇLot of inputs hereÔºå your PM plan„ÄÇ

 project documentsÔºå look at all these different documentsÔºå the assumption log„ÄÇ

 how did you create your estimatesÔºå your time and cost estimatesÔºå what about cost forecasting„ÄÇ

 the issue logÔºå lessons learned register that milestone list we saw that back in planning and an initiating with our charter„ÄÇ

 our quality reportsÔºå the risk registerÔºå the risk reportÔºå schedule forecast„ÄÇ

Work performance informationÔºå remember data informationÔºå we have agreements like contracts„ÄÇ

 and then EEF and OPA„ÄÇOur tools and techniquesÔºå expert judgmentÔºå new term data analysis„ÄÇ

 so in data analysisÔºå we're going to look at these different analysis types„ÄÇ

 you have alternatives analysisÔºå cost benefitsÔºå earned value analysisÔºå root causeÔºå trend analysis„ÄÇ

 variance analysisÔºå then we have decision makingÔºå and meetings„ÄÇ

Are outputs of monitoring and controlling the workÔºå work performance reportsÔºüChange request„ÄÇ

 are PM plan updatesÔºå project document updates so you could be updating things like your cost forecast„ÄÇ

 your issue logÔºå your lessons learnedÔºå your risk registerÔºå and even your schedule forecast„ÄÇ

Let me take just a minute and address something here„ÄÇ

 a question I usually get about this time in the course is all of these different documents you're not explaining„ÄÇ

 like I don't understand what a quality report isÔºå I don't understand what a schedule forecast is„ÄÇ

It's okayÔºå Project integration managerÔºå rememberÔºå is chapter 4 the PimbaokÔºå it's our first chapter„ÄÇ

 it's also the largest of all of the chaptersÔºå the reason why the processes in project integration management„ÄÇ

Will'll touchÔºå initiatingÔºå planningÔºå executingÔºå monitoringÔºå controlling and closing„ÄÇ

 We have a process in every process group„ÄÇ This is the only knowledge area that does that that goes all the way through the whole project management life cycle„ÄÇ

So right now to talk about quality reportsÔºå for example„ÄÇ

We don't talk about that in detail in chapter 4„ÄÇ that's done in detail Cha 4 the Piok„ÄÇ

 that's done in detail in chapter 8 in the Pimbaok on quality management„ÄÇSo right now„ÄÇ

 when you see these different terms or documents that you don't quite understand or you haven't quite been exposed to yet„ÄÇ

 just knowÔºå okayÔºå those are coming that right now it we're seeing an input So based on what happens with that quality report from chapter 8„ÄÇ

 that would affect how do we monitor and control the quality because remember this is like a big umbrella So that quality report could help us do some data analysis Well where are our quality problems or that schedule forecast„ÄÇ

 we could say all rightÔºå we're slipping on our schedule„ÄÇ

 how does that affect earn value as far as our schedule performance index or whatever you want there„ÄÇ

So I know we haven't looked at all these terms it's we're still„ÄÇ

Kind of upstream from all of these because we're just in chapter 4 the pembaok„ÄÇ

 So don't get discouraged„ÄÇ Just know this stuff is coming right now„ÄÇ Just roll with it„ÄÇThis is„ÄÇ

Integrated managementÔºå project integration management„ÄÇ

 So what we're looking at here is how it's integrated with all of the other knowledge areas„ÄÇ

 So right nowÔºå you just got to kind of roll with it„ÄÇ If you see something you don't knowÔºå Just say„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå I know that's coming„ÄÇ Take a note of it„ÄÇ And then when we get there later„ÄÇ

 you'll have that aha moment„ÄÇLet's talk about the difference between monitoring and controlling„ÄÇ

 Moning is more like an oversight„ÄÇ Controling is more like in and enforcing„ÄÇ So monitoring„ÄÇ

You do activities like collecting and measuringÔºå looking at the measurements before and after is the process improving„ÄÇ

 how healthy is the project„ÄÇWhat areas are going to require tension„ÄÇ

 So monitoring is more observation driven Control is what corrective and preventive actions do we need„ÄÇ

 Let's do some replaning here„ÄÇ I'm going to follow up on these action plans and then have these plans„ÄÇ

 have they improved our performance„ÄÇ So you can see monitoring is more observation and controlling is more enforcing and being involved„ÄÇ

 So we need bothÔºå but there will be times we see that we're only monitoring or only controlling„ÄÇ

Some activities that you do in monitoring and controlling„ÄÇ you look at actuals against planned„ÄÇ

 you assess performance to see do I need corrective or preventive action„ÄÇ

 What about the status of my risksÔºå so we'll do some risk tracking„ÄÇ

And then we need some accurate timely information about the product„ÄÇ

 so we have to maintain that this thing that we're creatingÔºå it has to be updated„ÄÇ

 and we want to communicate that and track it„ÄÇWe'll also give information on status reports„ÄÇ

 so we'll talk about measurements and forecasting like cost and time„ÄÇ

 scope when we're actually going to be done„ÄÇMonitoring implementation of approved change request so a change is approved„ÄÇ

We've got to make sure it goes into the project„ÄÇWe're going to communicate our status so status reporting„ÄÇ

 and if we want to make sure that our project is in aligned with our business needs„ÄÇ

 that it's not drifting awayÔºå get to keep things in alignment with what our business value that our business needs were for the project„ÄÇ

Let's talk about some terms you're going to see throughout monitoring and controlling in each one of our knowledge areas„ÄÇ

 We have alternative analysis„ÄÇ Al analysis are just what are my alternatives so I can use oracle or I can use SQL I can use O or I could use plywood„ÄÇ

 So those are alternatives when it comes to monitoring and controlling though„ÄÇ

 alternatives are okay well what type of corrective and preventive actions do I need to fix and present prevent problems So what are the different solutions I could come up with„ÄÇ

 So alternatives to just redoing the workÔºå Is there a fix here instead of having to go out and redo all the work Can I make some adjustments and it's okay„ÄÇ

Cost benefit analysisÔºå so corrective actions in relation to the cost benefit of actually doing those corrections„ÄÇ

 So you think about this room as eggshell white and it was supposed to be bone white„ÄÇ

 It's just a little tiny difference there„ÄÇ All right„ÄÇ

 it's going to cost us $1200 to redo it or can we just live with itÔºå we made a mistake„ÄÇ

 but now we're just going to live with it„ÄÇ So cost benefit analysis„ÄÇ

Eard value analysis and we'll talk about this in Cha 7 in the Pembaok„ÄÇ

 but earned value is a suite of formulas to show project performance„ÄÇ

 so it's a whole bunch of formulas that are going to say how healthy is the project„ÄÇ

 and we'll see that in Cha 7 on cost managementÔºå but you can really use that throughout the project„ÄÇ

Some other things here about data analysis and monitoringÔºå root cause and causal analysis„ÄÇ

Root cause is where we're aren looking to treat the symptomsÔºå we're looking to treat the cause„ÄÇ

 so the classic example here is you have a runny nose„ÄÇ

 you know blowing your nose or wiping your noseÔºå that's the symptom„ÄÇ

 but understanding you've got an allergy„ÄÇThat's the root cause„ÄÇ So in a projectÔºå it's well„ÄÇ

 what's actually causing activities to be late or what's causing this defect from this piece of equipment„ÄÇ

 So I'm looking for causal factors which are contributing to the effect„ÄÇ

 So this is where we get into causeÔºå effectÔºå cause and effect analysis„ÄÇ

 And we'll see that in quality in detail„ÄÇTrend analysisÔºå am I noticing a trend„ÄÇ

 am I always having to deal with one person that's late„ÄÇ

 are we consistently having a problem from a piece of equipment„ÄÇ

 how it's stepping when it's creatingÔºå you it's punching out a material or it's creating a product and it's consistently off just a little bit so is there a trend thereÔºü

And in variance analysisÔºå we do a lot of variance analysis„ÄÇ

 variance analysis is simply the difference between what was planned and what was experienced„ÄÇ

 so you have cost varianceÔºå schedule varianceÔºå you could have some quality variances„ÄÇ

 so variance analysis is what's the difference hereÔºå and then that helps us find root cause„ÄÇ

All rightÔºå good jobÔºå keep moving forward„ÄÇ
