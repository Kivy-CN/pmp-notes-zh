Once we have the project management plan created in particular the schedule management plan。

 a subsidiary plan， then we can go about defining activities this is to create the activities list all of the activities that we have to do in order for the scope to be complete。

So to define activities we're talking about taking our work breakdown structure and the smallest item in the WBS is a work package and we're correlating that work package to the activities that are needed in order to create the work package。

 so I need the WBS and I'm going to rely on the decomposition of scope to identify the work package and that allows me then to create the activity list。

The activity list is really needed because it helps me estimate if those are what I'm going to schedule and also to control the work。

Along with our activities， we'll define what are the activity attributes so that each activity will have different attributes or characteristics that we want to be aware of。

The milestone list shows all of the activities that lead up to creating that milestone。

 so recall typically at the end of a phase， we get a milestone or you have a key deliverable in your project that's a milestone Well as far as activities go。

 we can see the activities that are needed in order to create that milestone。

Let's look at the EOs for the activity list。Our inputs， the PM plan。

 in particular the schedule management plan and the scope baseline， remember the scope baseline。

 scope statement， the work breakdown structure， and the WBS dictionary。

And then we'll have EEF and OPA。Some tools and techniques here， expert judgment， decomposition。

 rolling wave planning， and meetings。Our outputs will be the activity list， the activity attributes。

 that milestone list we were just talking about。 you could have change request。

 we might have updates to the project management plan。

 in particular your schedule baseline and your cost baseline could be an output here。

Defining the project activities so the project work and project manager work so there's a difference here。

 the project work we're talking about the activities that will create the project scope。

 the project manager work sometimes called LOE level of effort are the activities that you have to do in order to manage the project so quality control the inspection。

The creation of a report that's PM work planning is PM work while those are needed they don't necessarily contribute to the creation of the project scope。

 but often we still need to schedule those activities to make certain they happen so you might schedule quality control inspection after key deliverables or you might schedule when reports are to happen on a regular basis or when meetings happen on a regular basis in your project so that's project management work that doesn't necessarily contribute to the scope。

 the creation of the product scope。Other planning processes。

 so you think about in each one of our knowledge areas that takes time to plan。

 so you think about scope and cost， quality， planning for HR communications planning and risk will spend a lot of time in risk planning and then in procurement you may have some planning issues there in stakeholder engagement and planning is iterative so you're never really done with planning until you finally go into closing。

What about the procurement time and the sequence of activities。

 so the sequence of activities we're talking about what order should these happen？

So that helps us to create the schedule or at least the flow of the work。

The procurement time we have to consider the lead time to purchase something。

 so I need these cabinets installed in 40 days from now。

 procurement takes 30 days for it to happen to get the materials on site。

 so I have to think about 30 days from now I need the cabinets， so that affects my schedule。

Internal and external events， so internal events could be things like resource availability。

 company holidays， where resources are used at other projects or somebody's taking a vacation。

External events， the weather， laws and regulations。

 the vendor has an issue with getting the materials， those are really outside of your control。

Kown in unknown events， known events we're talking about risk that I know these things are going to happen unknowns are you know no one knows that a project team member could quit in the middle of your project or the project could get canceled may not have the money to put into the project to continue to fund it so unknown events can obviously wreck your schedule。

The decomposition of project activities we're talking about taking the work packages in the WBS and then breaking those down into the work。

 the activities to create the work packages。See in theory， if we do the activities。

 we're creating the work packages， if we complete all of the work packages。

 then we're completing that deliverable in the WBS if we create all the WBS deliverables。

 then we have satisfied the project scope， you satisfied the project scope。

 you've met the project scope and then your project is accepted。

 so that's kind of the rollup of activities here。There's that little rule you ought to be familiar with called the 880 rule。

When we decompose the work breakdown structure， we don't want to get so granular that we just keep breaking things down or breaking things down all the way down to the screw that goes into a cabinet。

We want to use a general rule here。 It's called a heuristic that we say between 8 hours and 80 hours。

 That's how long each work package should take to create。

 So if it's you know installing a doork knob All right， that might take two hours。

 That's a little too granular。 we might just say install the door。 well， that might be four hours。

 So we might say install all the doors or complete the finishing for each room。

 So it's just a way of sizing the work that needs to be done。 It's a general rule。

 sometimes you might want to be very clear， we need a door。

 a special door that's going to go into the laundry room。All right， so the 880 rules just heuristic。

 so anything less than8 hours in your activity list is too small。

 anything greater than 80 hours though is too big， so it's just try to stay in that window between 8 and 80 hours。

The decompposed of project activities， three inputs that we really need， the scope baseline。

 because we're talking about the WBS and the WBX dictionary and the scope statement。

Enterprise environmental factors at OPA。That those are all things that we need to decompose project activities。

Some other planning components to consider we have control accounts and planning packages。

 I talked a little bit about this way back in the scope management。

 Let's just have a clear definition here， a control account or a control account plan。

 it's like a little marker in your WBS。 So recall that I'm building a house for you。

 and in this example。We know we need a kitchen， I don't need to know everything today for the kitchen deliverable。

 but I know that we need a kitchen and that kitchen is going to have a budget of 75。

000 and most kitchens take us about a month to complete everything， so 75。

000 and about a month of labor， not saying just one contiguous， that much labor equates to 30 days。

Well， you have to make decisions about what goes in to the kitchen， and we have $75，000。

So you have to decide what are the appliances， what's the countertop。

 what's the cabinets you would like， what's the flooring， that's all part of the kitchen。

All of those decisions are planning packages。SoP packages。

 as you say well I want this countertop and these are it's going to cost $10。

000 Well that planning package is now worth $10，000 and we have 75000 so you have 65。

000 left to make decisions on appliances on counters on flooring and so on so it's some accountability and that control account plan based on your choices will determine how we consume the budget and the time to actually make that happen。

Now， there can be some issues that happen here with planning components。For example。

 we have to know what type of countertops you want。By December 1。

 so if you don't tell me by December 1， then we're gonna be late because I need know do you want a marble。

 do you want granite， do you want poured concrete， you know what's the material or the type of countertops that you want and and we have to know by December1 So you have deadlines if you miss the deadline on the decision then some of your choices might go away All right。

 you've missed the deadline， you can't do marble now because it takes too long So now you have to choose know one of these choices or it could just be an issue It's gonna push the project So those are planning components that affect scheduling。

Great job， keep moving forward。
