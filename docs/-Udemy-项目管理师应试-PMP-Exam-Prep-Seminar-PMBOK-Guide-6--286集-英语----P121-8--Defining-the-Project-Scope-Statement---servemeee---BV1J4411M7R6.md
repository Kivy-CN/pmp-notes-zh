。Now we're going to talk about defining the project scope statement this is a really important process that's going to be based on a lot of the things we've already covered。

 but we're creating here a document， an actual document that defines what is the project scope。

So defining the project scope statement is about this detailed description of what we're creating about the project and the product scope。

It describes what's the output here， what's the product， the service or results。

 So what are we giving the customer。And then it allows us to create some boundaries and acceptance criteria。

So defining the project scope， what will be included and what will not be included。

 so that's the idea of boundaries。The process of defining the scope is to create a scope statement。

The scope statement then will allow us to break that down and create a work breakdown structure and a WBS dictionary and those three things kind of package up the scope baseline。

 the scope statement， the WBS and WBS dictionary， those three things are the scope baseline。

Adaptive environments， though， they define more of a high level vision。

 and then in each iteration that product backlog is refined and prioritized。

 and that becomes the scope， the set of requirements to work on for this iteration。

 so it's a little different and adaptive。Let's check out our Es for Def scope。

The inputs all need the project charter， the project management plan。

 and particularly the scope management plan， which we just created。Project documents。

 the assumption log， the requirements documentation makes sense right。

 we need the requirements to say what's in scope and the risk register willll also need the EEF and OPAs that are relevant to scope in a project。

Tools and techniques， expert judgment。Data analysis。

Decision making is one of those that we've not seen so far。Interpersonal and team skills。

 primarily facilitation and then product analysis。The outputs of defined scope is the project scope statement。

Project documents， we're updating project documents。

 we'll be updating things like the assumption log， the requirements documentation。

 the RTM and the stakeholder register。Let's take a look at the enterprise environmental factors and OPAAs for scope definition。



![](img/057a3601b629159342ae0cd3e7620cd6_3.png)

So what enterprise environmental factors would we need will your culture of where you work？

The infrastructure。Personnel administration and marketplace conditions。

 those all affect how you define scope for OPAs， it's going to be things like policies and procedures and templates such as change control。

Historical information is always a good source of OPA and lessons learned is an OPA。

In order to define the project scope， I want to rely on some experts here， I want consultant。

 stakeholders， even the customers because they're close to the requirements。

 I want professional and technical associations so my different the discipline I work in or your application field you're going to call on the technical associations there to help you think about what kind of requirements are needed and that will help with time and cost as well。

And then subject matter experts， so SMmeEs can help you interact with the customer and think about requirements and to make sure you've captured everything that you want to create。

Product analysis， Product analysis here。 we got some new terms。So product breakdown。

 product breakdown is where I take a product。This clicker， for example。

 and we break it down and we see what's each component in here， what does it， what's it do。

 what's it responsible for requirements analysis， I get my requirements from the B A。

 and then I really study those and have a good understanding。

Systems analysis is a way of studying how does a system work now this could have a couple different meaning here one。

 how does it work and we're approving upon it， how should it work and we're creating a whole new system so a system is a way of how does work get done。

 how do you get through the work so system analysis is the study of a system The next one is systems engineering and that is the building of a system。

Value engineering is a way of saying in our component here， our product that the。Each component。

 each thing here has to contribute to the value。And so what's the minimum amount of engineering or。

Design that we need in order to get that value。 So can I change the thickness of this plastic and reduce cost。

 but increase value。 So those two goes together。 Value engineering is where I study the value of all these different components in the product。

And that value analysis is， well， what is the real value。

 how does that contribute to the overall that nothing in this should cost more than its contribution to value。

 so it's trying to find the minimum amount without affecting the value that it gives to the customer。

So in other words， we， we don't need this made out of gold in order to be functional。

 So and then each button on here is a function。 But what's the minimum amount of。

Mechanics and materials that I need in order to meet expectations of the customer。

You might have one question on these for product analysis when it comes to scope definition。

Alternative generation is a way of saying all right， I've got multiple choices here。

 tile or carpet or wood， so I can do benchmarking， this is how it worked。

 the soundproofing work versus this soundproofing material work， so which one do I choose。Systems。

 so the way of getting the work done order in order out。

 I can do alternatives generation with vendors， lots of choices with vendors。

 What about different materials， of course， and resources。

 Se engineer versus junior engineer One costs more can get done faster。 one costs less。

 but will take longer， So that's you know resources。 Re don't have to be just people。

 though it could be materials， equipment facilities you're going to compare different airlines。

 that could be a resource。So let's look at what goes into a scope statement。

 We know we describe the product scope。 It's the thing you're going to create。

It also describes all the project deliverables。 What's the acceptance criteria。

 How do you know we're successful and then what's excluded， We're going to build a house。

 but we do not build the swimming pool。 We'll build a house， but we do not include the appliances。

 They got buy your own stove and fridge and all that stuff。

The project charter versus the project scope， let's compare and contrast and get a lot of questions on these。

Generally， the charter is more high level， and it's about authority。 The scope is much more specific。

 and it's about deliverables。 So the charter is about why are we doing the project。

 What are the objectives， What are the high level requirements， the high level description。

What are the big picture risks here in this type of work in our project？

What's the milestone schedule， the summary milestone。

 So it's kind of a guess of where we should be based on starting today stakeholder list so that your general stakeholders。

 who signs off on things， who's the PM and how much authority they have and then who's the project sponsor So it's more about getting started and authorizing the project。

The scope， though， is very clear。It's the scope description。 What are we creating。

 What do you get as a result of this thing， What are the acceptance criteria and then what's excluded。

 So that's the scope。 So really know the charters about authorizing and starting things。

 The scope is getting very specific on what we will create。All right， good job。
