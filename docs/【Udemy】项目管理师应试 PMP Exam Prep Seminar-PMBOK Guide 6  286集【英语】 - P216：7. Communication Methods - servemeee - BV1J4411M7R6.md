🎼。🎼うん。🎼。All right， welcome back let's talk about some different ways that we can communicate some communication methods。

 so we need to look at some terms here that you'll want to recognize for your exam。

So first off interactive communication it's just we interact with each other。

 we have two or more parties in real time talking or in a chat or what have you so you think about phone calls or meetings face to face or web collaboration meetings or even just some adhoc conversation。

 you know you're at lunch or in the hallway and you're just having a conversation it's more informal in that case。

A push communication is like an email， I push it to these specific people。

 so it's distributed now in email we don't really have a way of confirming。

Have people received it and understood it so you might see a little green check mark that they opened it。

 we don't know if they read it， but and we certainly don't know if they understand it。

 so I just push it out。 it's like a one way， a push out the message like I send you a memo if we want to go old school。

 I don't know if you got it， you open the little Inter office envelope and there's the memo。

 I really need you to confirm that you're reading it and you understand it。

Poull communication is where the opposite that I have like a website or a database and you pull information from my website or database that it's a ideal for large complex information sets so you're doing a query about what activities are in motion so it would search our project database there through SharePoint or whatever and then you could run a report but you're polling that from what we have shared so if we share it。

 we know that there's some security involved here， so do you have permission to access that or are you technologically allowed to access that information。

You might have a web portal or an intranet or even a public website。

 so things like eLarning in your course， your lessons Learn database in knowledge management or your knowledge repositories that you could search against to retrieve information to make decisions in the project。

 so that's all pull communication though， so it takes the user to go and they want that information and they query and they pull it。

Then we have interpersonal communication probably the best kind frankly。

 is we have individuals face to face， it's clear you get body language。

 you have an opportunity to respond， people often face to face are much more comfortable than when they're in a big group and they have to speak up in front of everyone。

 so interpersonal and face to face is typically ideal。

Small group communication is just like three to six people。

 so it's still pretty comfortable like a meeting， a small meeting。

 you know three peoples very small six people， you know it's a little bit more involved but it's still pretty comfortable and everybody can have an opportunity to speak you ever go to those meetings where there's 20 people in the room and about three people are doing the talking。

Real effective editorial。 Okay， public communication， single speaker to a group。

 So you've got a public presentation to do。 There you go。

Mass communication is I'm going to have minimal contact with the group so I'm sending out a huge email blast about our project or we're going to take out an ad in the newspaper that explains our public project so a fullp ad and what we're doing with this bridge or this you know warehouse we're going make into condos or whatever the case may be so it's minimal connection but it's a mass amount of group。

Networks and social computing， so Facebook， LinkedIn， what have you， Instagram， whatever you use。

 a way to give that message to distribute that message out。

 so it's a mini to many where we can comment on it and other people comment on it and you can still respond。

 so social computing so using technology and the media there to give out information about your project。

When we communicate， we create artifacts and artifact is just the physical thing that you create as a result of communication。

 so some common ones here， I'm not going to read all these to you but some common ones， newsletters。

 press releases， reports， your web portal。Phone calls， that's an interesting one。

 A phone call is verbal， but we might document what was said in the phone call。

 but a phone call is it is an artifact。 we have a history of it， you hope， but it's a verbal。

 so that one's a little shaky Presentations， focus groups， your social computing technology。

 Those are all artifacts。 So an artifact is the result of communication。

 The thing that you create by communicating。All right， good job， keep moving forward。
