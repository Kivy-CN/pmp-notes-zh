Let's talk about the results of managing quality Of course this is a process that's done throughout the project。

 so it's not like you do it once and you're done， but you do it throughout so you're going to have these outputs over and over like the quality report。

 your test and evaluation documentation， and then you might have change request。

Other results of managing quality may be updates to your project management plan。

 so based on what you discover allows you to go back and change your plan to adjust things to meet quality。

 so you might update the quality management plan， you might update the scope baseline。

 the schedule baseline and the cost baseline。You could also have updates to your project documents like the issue log。

 your lessons learned to register， and even the risk register。

 so these are the primary outputs from managing quality。Very important to note here。

Managing quality is an executing activity so recall in our project management life cycle you go from planning to executing and then down here we have monitoring and controlling and then from monitoring and controlling we can go back to planning we can also go back up to executing so we have this iteration of plan do check and the new act so PDCA that dimming cycle is somewhat built into our approach of planning and managing and as we'll see coming up controlling quality so keep that in mind as we go through these processes all right good job。
