üéº„ÄÇNow that we've talked about the relationship between activities„ÄÇ

 we can get in and begin creating a network diagram„ÄÇ

 so to create a network diagram we're talking about visualizing the project work„ÄÇ

 we're talking about the flow of the project workÔºå so we're showing the relationship of our work activities and how the project flows from the start to the end„ÄÇ

The only type of network diagram you need to know for your exam is called activity on node AON„ÄÇ

 like in this little picture hereÔºå Act C and D and E„ÄÇ

 that's an activity and so the arrows just show the flow„ÄÇ

 the nodes are where all the information is about the activity„ÄÇ

What we use and what you'll be using and need overview for your exam is called the precedence diagramming method„ÄÇ

 the precede diagramming method is like we saw with our relationship between activities„ÄÇ

 we have successors and predecessorsÔºå so predecessors our upstream successors or downstream„ÄÇ

It's the most commonÔºå it's what Microsoft Project uses if you were to draw out the flow of your work like you start here and you end up here in the flow of all your activities„ÄÇ

 you'll be using PDN so what's the predecessor and a successor each activity„ÄÇ

Can be a predecessor and a successorÔºå so you could have an activity to prime the wall„ÄÇWell„ÄÇ

 this could be a successor to install the drywall if you have to put the drywall up first„ÄÇ

 then you can prime the wallÔºå so it succeeds„ÄÇThe drywallÔºå wellÔºå after this„ÄÇ

Any activity after this would succeed this guy„ÄÇ So this could be paint the wall„ÄÇ

 So paint the wall is now a successor„ÄÇ And this guyÔºå in this instanceÔºå is a predecessor„ÄÇ

So don't let that trick you that it could only be one of the other„ÄÇ

 so an activity could be both because you could have predecessors and successors„ÄÇ

The activities are put in little squaresÔºå these are the nodes„ÄÇ

 you might sometimes see them in a circle but squares are the most common„ÄÇ

 and then the arrows that you'll see in this let's take a look now„ÄÇ

 the arrows that you see or the connection of the lines that you see are just show the flow of the work so sometimes you don't see an arrow and other times you will don't let that trick you„ÄÇ

 it's just the flow of the workÔºå the lines show how the work flows„ÄÇ

So in this example we're seeing these different nodes and we're seeing a lot of different numbers„ÄÇ

 so we're moving closer to schedule network analysis„ÄÇ

 I know that's what a lot of you are eager to seeÔºå but this is our sample network diagram This is a schedule model of how do we go from the start all the way to the end and so we'll see this in more detail we're getting there„ÄÇ

 where we're going to figure out how do we find floatÔºå This is how we do it„ÄÇ

 This is what we base it on is you have to have a network diagram to examine so Hant we're getting there it's coming„ÄÇ

Network templates just like our activity listÔºå there's no reason to start from scratch every time„ÄÇ

 so if I have a similar projectÔºå let's just adapt it if you always have the same flow of works or nearly the same flow of work„ÄÇ

 you could have a prepopulated network diagram that you just adapt so again this is an organizational process asset„ÄÇ

Keep moving forward„ÄÇ
