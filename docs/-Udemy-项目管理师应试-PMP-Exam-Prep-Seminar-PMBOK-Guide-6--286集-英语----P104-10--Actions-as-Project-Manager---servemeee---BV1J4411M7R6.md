Now let's talk about some actions that you'll have to take as a project manager。 First off。

 we have corrective action。 This is where you're fixing a problem。

 so you're realigning the project performance。Preventive action is where you don't want to make the mistake again。

 so you are ensuring future performance。Now， corrective action and preventive action can go hand in hand。

 And then it ties in with our next action here， which is defect repair。

 So let me give you an example。 We have 1000 doors to install in a building。

 and we have four or five different groups of people that are going out installing these doors。 Well。

 we do some inspection。 So some quality control。 And we notice that about 50 of the 300 doors we've installed so far are installed incorrectly。

 So we need to do corrective action， which is also defect repair that we're fixing the problem。

 We're modifying that nonconformance。 The doors aren't installed properly。 Well。

 what we also do is we bring everyone together and we do a little bit of training so that we ensure future performance so that everyone is installing the doors correctly from this point forward。

😊，Now these actions， corrective and preventive action and defect repair。

 they require a change request typically you're going to have to do a change request because it's time and money that you're spending。

Correcttive action， we're talking about current results。

 We want to realign the project work back to our project plan。

 We want to make certain the work we're doing is in scope And then getting rid of items that are not in scope。

 So scope creep or gold plating those are not acceptable here。 remember。

 scope creep as our scopes getting beloated by tiny changes or gold plating。

 we're just trying to consume the budget by adding bells and whistles that wasn't really approved。

Preventive action， we want things like safety， training。

 looking for problems or risk that could happen。 so this ties into Cha 11 on risk management。

Now defect repair is we have a nonconforming product like those doors that weren't installed properly。

 so it kind of ties back to corrective action so you want to fix the problem and then we have defect repair validation。

 I want to make sure it was fixed that when you go and fix the problem。

 make certain that it's of quality now that it's conforming to our requirements。

Then you might have to do some updates here， so you may have to look at your project documentation and your plans and what updates are happened so that may require a change request。

 So changes to project documentation can be things like activity less because now you have activities to redo the work Are there assumptions。

 What about your lessons learned So you don't have to do this again and again and again。

 are we going to learn from the problems so we don't have it again。 So corrective action。

And preventive action tie in together there。Requirements， documentation。

 So you have to update your requirements make certain that everything is conforming to the requirements we want clarity on requirements。

 Are there any risk And then our stakeholder register comes into play here。

 So these are all changes that could come about because of these actions。

 And then these formally controlled changes means you likely need a change request， And of course。

 you'll have updates to OPA。🎼。
