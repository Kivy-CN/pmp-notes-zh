Welcome to this section on scheduleed management„ÄÇWhenever we talk about schedule management„ÄÇ

 people get really excited„ÄÇ

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_2.png)

Well maybe excited„ÄÇ It's not the right wordÔºå but they get very interested because it's in this section that we're going to talk about float„ÄÇ

 SoÔºå yesÔºå this is where you want to be„ÄÇ if you want to hop in and really nail down how to find float„ÄÇ

 how to find the critical path„ÄÇ But that's not the only thing we're going to talk about„ÄÇ

 there's a lot of other terms and things that you need to know when it comes to schedule management„ÄÇ

 So if you're following along in the Pibaok guideÔºå this section on schedule management is chapter 6 in the Pimbaok on schedule management„ÄÇ

 So we're going to talk aboutÔºå as alwaysÔºå trends and emerging practices in schedule management„ÄÇ

 So adaptive environment considerations„ÄÇ and we'll talk about creating the schedule management plan„ÄÇ

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_13.png)

Defining the activities and then doing some rolling wave planningÔºå new term for you„ÄÇ



![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_15.png)

Creating the activity list and a milestone listÔºå how those two are related„ÄÇ

And then we're going to sequence the activities„ÄÇ We have to put the activities in the order in which they should happen„ÄÇ

 and that will allow us to create a project network diagram„ÄÇ

 So setting us up for float in the critical path„ÄÇ We need to considerÔºå though„ÄÇ

 two new terms that affect our schedulingÔºå and that's leads and lags„ÄÇ

 So two new terms we'll talk about in this section„ÄÇ



![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_17.png)

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_18.png)

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_19.png)

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_20.png)

Estimating activity durationsÔºå we have to know how long an activity is going to last in order to predict the critical path„ÄÇ

 so we need a duration on our activities„ÄÇ

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_22.png)

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_23.png)

Then we'll develop the scheduleÔºå we'll look at any constraints or assumptions that affects our schedule or may affect our decisions in scheduling„ÄÇ

 and then we get into floatÔºå scheduleÔºå network analysis„ÄÇ

 so how to find float we'll talk about that in this section of course„ÄÇ

 and I have an assignment for you where you're going to complete a float„ÄÇ

 a network diagram and find floatat„ÄÇ

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_25.png)

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_26.png)

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_27.png)

![](img/b22fb161cc159b461ea0e8cf7250d757_28.png)

And then we'll come back and talk about agile release planning„ÄÇ

 something you'd either know for your examÔºå controlling the project schedule„ÄÇ

 and then measuring project performance so a lot of information to talk about in this section I know you're eager to get to it so let's start that now go ahead and let's go to the next lecture„ÄÇ
