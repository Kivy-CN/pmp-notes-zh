Welcome back。In this section， we'll talk about project risk management。

Project Ris management is chapter 11 in the Pimbaok Guide。

We're going to discuss just the big picture， the big concepts of risk management。 What is a risk。

 How does it affect your project， How do we manage those risks。

 So all that type of business we'll talk about here at the beginning of this section。

Then we're going to drill down a little bit deeper and talk about creating a risk management plan。

 The risk management plan will direct us and how we do the other risk management activities。

 So we'll be looking at examining stakeholder tolerances and what is a stakeholder tolerance or stakeholder threshold for risk。

 So risk management policies that you have to consider as you do your planning and management of risk。

Then we'll get into risk identification and ongoing activity that we do throughout the project with risk identification it helps us to capture the risk events and then that allows us to go in and do qualitative and then quantitative risk analysis so we'll look at both of those versus quantitative and how do I keep those straight in my mind so we'll talk about qualitative and quantitative。

Then we'll do an analysis of our risk and that helps us define a contingency reserve。

We'll also examine a really important topic for your exam， risk responses。

 so planning risk responses， and I have an assignment with you to really reinforce these different risk responses as you want to be able to recognize these responses and to know when which responses most appropriate。

 so planning risk responses we'll talk about justifying risk reduction about spending money to reduce probability and impact and then we'll talk about monitoring risks。

Well a lot of information， really important stuff here， but I have confidence you can do this。

 so let's hop in and knock this out now in this section on project risk management。
