。Let's talk about some emerging trends in procurement you should be aware of first off there's all sorts of new tools。

 so online tools so one of the things we'll see will be advertising you have to advertise in some government projects like it's open for bidd or an invitation for bidd that's public knowledge well now a lot of that can be done online not in the classifieds in the newspaper。

There are some advances in risk management that are tied to procurement。

 so you may have some specific risks that you assigned to entities that will just handle that part of the project for you。

 so for example， we have dangerous work， you would say anything related to the electrical work is going to be handled by the ABC electriclectric company So it's kind of a blanket for your project a way of saying all of those risk we do transference and we have a contract with that ABC electricallect company to manage that portion of the project。

It's possible that you want to change your contracting projects depending on the type of work or the size of the project。

Really big projects like billion dollar international projects that kind of have this new term tied in called a mega project。

 and I like to say that a mega project。You might have terms tied to infrastructure development。

 so you may have some laws， regulations， accountability to the public。

 you have to have a communications office to explain what's happening and road closures and progress。

 maybe a website so that could all be in the contract as well engineering projects。

 you may have specifications for the type of engineers， the PEs， the architects。

 the structural engineers， even mechanical engineers， you think about all those different。

Qualified individuals that participate in engineering projects and what the requirements may be there。

And you may have some special terms for multibillion dollar projects。

 so you may describe like financing， interest rate we'll see coming up in this course economic adjustment。

 so if the cost of steel were real high that could be accounted for in the project in our contract like the cost of steel could fluctuate so we would give some allowances for that up or down。

Some other trends you should be familiar with logistics and supply chain management。

 you don't have to be an expert at this for your exam。

 just be topically familiar with this idea so you think about large projects getting a lot of materials from all over or shipping materials all over the world。

 a lot of logistics that have to happen there， so that flow of material is critical to project success。

Also think about the lead time， so a lot of forecasting and coordination will happen on a large project with lots of moving parts and lots of materials and such。

Technology and stakeholder relations are also something we have to take into consideration so you think about public funded projects。

 the public is a stakeholder， the media may be investigating your project and want to see where the money is being spent。

 things like that。Same with infrastructure and big commercial construction projects and one thing that's becoming pretty popular and I think is really cool are webcams。

 so maybe you've seen like these big construction project and there's a webcam there so you can go and log in any time and look at what's happening in that construction project and then it's always fun at the end where they speed it up and everybody's working so rapidly and that you see it all come together。

 but that's just a way of communicating， but that could be part of procurement that you have to have some visibility here。

 many different webcam angles and always showing what's happening on the job site。

You might also do a trial engagement where we have a very big contract that we want to do with a vendor but we're going to try it out on a small scale。

 so we'll do a small engagement first and if that goes well then we'll go on and let you have the rest of the contract so it's a full commitment based on this initial performance so that's a pretty neat idea in procurement。

Of course we can tailor procurement processes if we don't need to procure well there's a quick tailor that we don't mess with those processes。

 the complexity of procurement is something that you may tailor know to what depth depending what you're buying。

 how big your project is if it's a long- termm project or short term or youre buying goods or services or a combination of both so you can tailor and you can put anything in a contract that you want as long as it's legal。

The physical location， so access to the site， you think about environmental concerns and disrupting the neighbors there。

 that those are things you would tailor in add to your contracting。

Of course you would have an adherence to government and regulatory environment and you may have some business there about who is responsible to adhere to the law。

 so if I hire someone to build something for me I don't know anything about the building codes or the laws or so on so our contract would spell that out as the who is adhering to codes who's responsible for that and I would probably get an attorney or an expert to help make certain the terms of that contract cover me。

 the buyer and that the seller is responsible for meeting these governance or regulatory concerns。

And of course， the ability and availability of the contracts ability。

 you know you got to be qualified to do this or you're out。

 but the availability So you think about building a house。

 when do people come from that builder to work on the home so okay。

 we sign a contract to build a house， but my team is committed for the next three or four months。

 So what's the availability and that affects our contract and tailoring as well。

All right， good job， keep moving forward。
