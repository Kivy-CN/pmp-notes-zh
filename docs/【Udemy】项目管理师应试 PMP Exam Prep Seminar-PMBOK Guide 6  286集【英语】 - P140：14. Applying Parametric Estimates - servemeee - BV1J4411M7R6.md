Another estimating approach is called a parametric estimate a parametric estimate means that we have a parameter for estimating you use a parametric estimate when we have repetitive work when we can identify the learning curve So examples of a parametric estimate there's some type of an algorithm to calculate the duration of activities so a time per unit so it will take two hours to install every fixture it takes eight hours to install the garage doors and you've got a bunch of garage doors to install in your condo association so a time per unit square footage and again historical data can help predict this so you just have some parameter and you multiply it across I have 2000 units one hour each 2000 hours so it's a parameter to predict for repetitive information I can't do this with tasks that are the same it's for。

ative activities。Duration and effort are not the same thing。 duration。

 we're talking about how long an activity will take an effort we're talking about billable time for the labor。

 the effort， the amount of labor you exert to do something for a duration。

So here's an example of effort and duration。We have an activity that's going to last 40 hours。

 we have a senior engineer and we also have a part time person that could also do this task right so two opposite extremes here。

The senior engineer could do this activity in 40 hours。The cost though。

 may be more to pay that senior engineer than what this activity is worth。A part timer。

 they could do this in two segments of 25 hours， so they're going to work 25 hours， one week。

 25 hours the next， so 50 hours total， but the duration is going to be two weeks right。

 it's going to be two weeks until they're done with that activity at only allowing 25 hours a week on that task。

The parther， though， they're a much lower rate than what our senior engineer is。

So we have to think about a couple things here， one， how long will that activity take to complete？

If the senior engineer does it， the duration will be 40 hours。If a part time employee does it。

 the duration will be 50 hours。But it will be two weeks because that resource is also limited to 25 hours a week。

So what's more important here， time or money， what we don't really know from this scenario。

But we may need that activity。Faster than two weeks。

 so it would be more cost effective to put the senior engineer on this activity and were done in five days。

 40 hours total than it would be to pay less， but it takes two weeks to get done。

So duration and effort are linked and we'll also see that when it comes to resource rates in the next chapter。

 the next section， when we talk about cost management。All right， great job， keep moving forward。
