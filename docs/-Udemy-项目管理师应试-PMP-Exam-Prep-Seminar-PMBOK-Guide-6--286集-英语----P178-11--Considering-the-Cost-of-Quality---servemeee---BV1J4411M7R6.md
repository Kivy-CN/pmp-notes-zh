Let's talk about the cost of quality。It's not cheap to get quality into your project quality takes time。

 it takes having the right tools and equipment， the right materials。

 so there's a cost associated with that。 there are two terms that we need to know when it comes to the cost of quality。

 we have the cost of conformance to requirements， and we have the cost of nonconformance to requirements。

The cost of conformance to requirements， sometimes just called the cost of quality。

 describes the monies that you have to spend in order to ascertain the expected level of quality in your project。

 So safety measures， you have to do team development and training， having the right materials。

 the right equipment， using the right processes。 That's all the cost of conformance to requirements。

 the cost of quality。The cost of nonconformance are all the bad things that happen when you don't have quality because you're not conforming to requirements。

 So you could have liabilities or loss of life or limb。 Some's going to get injured。

 and that's no good。 We don't want that at all。 You might have rework or scrap。

 We have to start over and go buy more materials。 You might have loss of business。

 So you have poor quality didn't conform to requirements and you get fired。

 or your company gets fired from that project。 So that's no good。Some types of quality cost。

 we have prevention， appraisal， and failure。Prevention is back to quality assurance。

 it's where we're delivering exactly what was requested， so we are taking the time。

 we have the training， the safety measures， having the right equipment。

 we're doing the work correctly and we're spending the money to ascertain quality。

 so it's a prevention quality cost。Appraisal is the time and money you need to go out and measure。

 and test and inspect， audit and evaluate the results of what you've created。

 and so it's typically appraisal we think about time to do an appraisal。

A failure is cost of nonconformance。 We've had poor quality， so we have internal failure。

 that's scrap and rework。 We have to throw away the stuff and start over。

 you've lost time and you've lost money for the material and the labor。

External failure are loss of sales， loss of customers downtime， and even damage to your reputation。

 so that's a failure cost， so prevention is QA appraisal is controlling quality and failure is the negative outcome。

 the cost of poor quality。So those are some terms you should be familiar with for your exam。
