Another process in project schedule management is control schedule， so we've planned it。

 we've done some executing and now we have to control we want to ensure that the execution。

 the activities that are being done are being controlled and done properly so control schedule in this process we're talking about schedule control and integrated change control measuring performance so with setting us up here for our next chapter where we're going to see earned value management looking for variances updating our schedule doing corrective actions as needed and documenting what we've learned so our lessons learned register。

Our Edos here for control schedule our inputs， obviously your project management plan will need our schedule management plan。

 our schedule baseline， our scope baseline， and our performance measurement baseline remember the PMB。

 it's really it's a combination of scope time and cost baseline。Project documents。

 the lessons learned registered， project calendars， the project schedule。

 resource calendars and schedule data， and then of course we have work performance data。

 this is the raw facts about what's happening with our activities， how many are done。

 how many are pending， how many are in， how many are late， that's all work performance data。

 and we'll have OPA。Tools and techniques to control schedule will do data analysis。

 we'll use earned value analysis， and we're going to see that in chapterpt 7 in the pinba the very next section in this course。

We'll have an iteration burned down sharp。 We'll look at that How many tasks are remaining。

 performance reviews， trend analysis， variance analysis。 What if scenario analysis。

The critical path method。Project management information system。

 resource optimization and leads and lags， Those are all tools and techniques we can do in control schedule Our outputs here will be our work performance information we'll take that data。

 we analyze it and then we get information we'll do schedule forecasting change request。

 you might have updates to your project management plan so the schedule management plan。

 the baseline schedule and cost and performance。And then we have updates to our documents， As log。

Basis of those estimates， lessons learned， register updates to your schedule to your resource calendars。

To the risk register， and then you'll have some scheduled data that may have to be updated。

When we talk about control schedule， we're really talking about integrated change control。

 recall that integrated change control is any change has to be examined for what effect does it have on the remainder of the project。

 so what effect does it have on time， on cost on quality。

 on scope on HR on communications on risk procurement and stakeholders。

 so it's the whole picture is integrated change control。

Part of integrated change control too when it comes to controlling time is we want to influence the factors that create changes。

 a nice way of saying your project team and vendors。We want to reconsider schedule reserves。

 have we put enough time back to account for things that may disrupt our project？

Has the project schedule changed at all？And then do you manage changes as they occur， Yes。

 so when a change happens， if someone's late， you look immediately at what does it do to your project and you react to it when there's a problem。

 we always go immediately to the problem。Now an agile or schedule control is a little different in agile we're looking at how much work was actually delivered in comparison to how much work did we say we could do so remember the user stories and we have story points if we say we have we can do 24 story points and that's way too aggressive。

 we only get done with 15 we need to adjust in our retrospective what work and what didn't work should we adjust the amount of story points we say we can get done。

So that helps us reprioritize。Also in agile， we determine the rate that deliverables are actually produced。

 the rate they're validated， and their acceptability， so that's called velocities。

 basically how fast can you get from creation to acceptance。

Has the project schedule changed and agile if it has， then we have to manage that change。

 we have to figure out based on the number of resources we have or our deadline that may been shifted that affects the amount of work that we can do and are that three to six month window for our release planning so in agile typically we we are we do accept change。

 but we also have to have some。Vision as to when the project's going to end。Great job。

 keep moving forward。
