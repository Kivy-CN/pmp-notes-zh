Do you buy stuff as a project manager， If you do， you probably are dealing with your procurement office or a contracting office。

 or maybe you're doing， maybe you're the one that's doing the procurement activity。 Well。

 a lot of project managers that I meet， they don't do any of that business。

 that's handled by other parts of their organization。

So I think that sets up a lot of project managers to get frustrated with this chapter on procurement because they don't do it。

Another thing that I see that happens is we're nearing the end of the course and this is kind of a boring。

 frankly it's kind of a boring section so people don't pay attention and then they go take their exam。

 notice I said take their exam and they don't pass because the procurement beats them up don't let that be you if you're feeling tired right now get up and do a stretch。
