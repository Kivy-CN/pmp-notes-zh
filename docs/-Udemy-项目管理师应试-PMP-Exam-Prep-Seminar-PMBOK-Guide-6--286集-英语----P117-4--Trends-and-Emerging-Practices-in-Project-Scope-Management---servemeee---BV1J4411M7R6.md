어。When we talk about gathering requirements or creating the project scope。

 or're just understanding the product scope。 chances are we're going to be working with a business analyst。

 Now， in your organization， as the project manager。

 you may be the one that's serving both as the project manager and a business analyst。

 A business analyst as an individual that can elicit requirements， gather requirements。

 package those up and really help define what the project should be creating。

 what the project scope will be。

So we need to know a little bit about the process， not a project management process。

 but just the process of what is business analyst Business analyst is all about gathering requirements and defining requirements and ensuring those requirements。

 satisfy the business needs， so it defines， manages and controls requirements。

So in a business analyst world， requirements may begin with a needs assessment。

With really understanding what the problem is or what do we really need or what we trying to solve。

In the PMI world， there is a certification on business analyst。

 the PMI PBA professional business analyst， so I think that's part of the reason why we're seeing more about business analyst in our PMP or CAPM exams because it's becoming more and more popular as a PMI certification and certainly we see this in the PiBO。

Let's take a look at some emerging trends for scope here when it comes to business analyst。

Often we partner or collaborate with business analysts and they're going to help us to identify problems or help the organization identify problems。

 and that helps define the business needs。 what should the project aim to accomplish and what are the business needs。

 and then they can make recommendations for solutions for those business needs or to address those problems。

Business analysts work to elicit， document and then manage those requirements， so eicit。

 manage and documentation。And they also can help facilitate the implementation。

 so often the B will be involved with gathering requirements。

 and then the project manager steps in with the team and executes those。

 and then at the end when we do an operational transfer。

 the B comes back because the B may be responsible for scope validation and that operational transfer。

 but it's really not that segmented in reality， we work with the business analyst throughout the project。

So project managers and business analysts really work together， we want a collaborative relationship。

 we don't want a combat relationship， there's no reason for that。

 or both of us on the same side of the table as at work。We're both on the same team。

 The B A has requirements， responsibilities。 The project manager has delivery responsibilities。

 So both the PM and the business analysts need to stay in their own swim lane that don't cross over and get in each other's way。

 And that's part of that collaborative partnership。All right， great job， though this information。

 you probably have maybe one or two questions about business analysts as it relates to requirements gathering and project management。
