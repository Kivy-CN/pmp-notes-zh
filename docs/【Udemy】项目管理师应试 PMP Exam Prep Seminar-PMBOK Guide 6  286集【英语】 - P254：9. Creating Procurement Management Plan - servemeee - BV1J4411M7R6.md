üéºÔºåThe Procurement management plan has a lot of information and it really defines„ÄÇ

How we're going to do the procurement processesÔºå how we'll do contracting„ÄÇ

 how we'll choose a vendor and so on„ÄÇ So there is some coordination that happens that needs to be defined in the procurement management plan between the buyer and the seller or between the sellers and the project team„ÄÇ

 So what about project activities if one of the vendors is going to be a team member„ÄÇ

 How do they actÔºå how do they report What about their scheduling So they need to have a resource calendar„ÄÇ

 So some scheduling here and then business operations„ÄÇ

 they have to behave as if they were a regular team memberÔºå even though they're a contract base„ÄÇ

 they need to be as if they were a team member„ÄÇAlso„ÄÇ

 the procurement management plan will define how will vendors be selected and what types of contracts are you allowed to use„ÄÇ

The procurement management plan will also define independent estimates or should cost estimates„ÄÇ

 So here's the deal in a should cost estimate„ÄÇ It is where we have a project to do„ÄÇ

 like we're going to run new network cable through the whole building„ÄÇ

 So we hired an electrician to come out and take all the measurements to look to see what we need and to create an estimate of what it would be„ÄÇ

 And we pay them for their time„ÄÇThat estimate that that electrician created becomes the mean that we compare all other bids against so it's a should cost estimate so when I receive a bid from a vendor to do that and they're way off like 50% off then they didn't understand it or maybe they don't want to do the work„ÄÇ

 but there's some reason why it was not close to our mean here„ÄÇ

 they didn't understand what the work is or who knows why„ÄÇ

 but it should cost means that this is what it should cost and the closest one to it„ÄÇ

 that'll be the one that we hire to do the rest of the project„ÄÇ

A should cost or independent estimate could also come from historical information„ÄÇ

 so you had a similar project and this is how much it costs in the past from the vendor„ÄÇ

 so that's what it should cost approximately for our current project„ÄÇ

You might have to work with a procurement office or a centralized contracting where they take care of all the procurement„ÄÇ

 thankfullyÔºå but for your examÔºå you'll still need to know these processes and activities„ÄÇ

What's the lead time for procurementÔºüAnd then what's the requirement of your contract for performance bonds or insurance„ÄÇ

 so often the contract will say you have to show proof of insurance like errors or omissions or liabilities or some type of a performance bonds that you don't wreck the project as the seller„ÄÇ

The procurement management plan will also define what forms and contracts we have to use„ÄÇ

 and we'll talk about these forms coming up„ÄÇ although some of this may be enterprise environmental factors„ÄÇ

 you have a specific form that you fill out to start the procurement process„ÄÇ

 If you're going to be working with multiple vendors„ÄÇ

 How will you manage that and all the interaction between the vendors„ÄÇ

 What metrics will you use for vendor selection„ÄÇ So you might have a screening system„ÄÇ

 like you have to have a PMmpP on staff„ÄÇ You have to have a CCciIS SP or a professional engineer or license in your state or who knows whatever you want„ÄÇ

 But those are screening systems„ÄÇ So how will you choose„ÄÇ

 what metrics will be there to choose which vendor you will select from„ÄÇAgainÔºå vendor certificates„ÄÇ

 insurance bondsÔºå licensingÔºå what risk mitigation and liabilities do you have to consider and document in your procurement management plan for contractingÔºü

And then always you have enterprise environmental factorsÔºå so when you put things up to bid„ÄÇ

 your organization may have rules and policiesÔºå even regulations that you have to follow when it comes to opening up projects for bid and choosing vendors„ÄÇ

The procurement management plan will also define the roles and responsibilities for the project team and then for the project manager and the procurement office„ÄÇ

 so everyone knows what they're responsible for as you enter into this contractual relationship„ÄÇ

I've mentioned a couple times the legal jurisdiction„ÄÇ

 often contracts will say that if there's a disagreement or a claim or a dispute„ÄÇ

 it'll be settled in the county of Madison and the state of Indiana or whatever„ÄÇ

Vendor payment and currencyÔºå so is it net 30Ôºå net 10Ôºå international project„ÄÇ

 is it US dollars or euro or whatever currency you specify in the contractÔºü

And then also what constraintsÔºå assumptionsÔºå what's your risk management approach„ÄÇ

 and then do you have pre qualifiedified sellersÔºå all of that is also defined in the procurement management plan„ÄÇ
