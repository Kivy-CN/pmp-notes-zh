Now that we've created our activity estimates， we've put things in order we know how long things are going to take and what resources will be affecting our project duration。

 we're ready to begin developing the schedule so this is where we are really defining the sequenceque of events we've already done sequencing but now we're taking consideration of the true sequencing as far as our network diagram goes and our duration and what's the duration of activities which tells us the duration of our project。

This also helps us to identify what resources are needed where and at what time。

 because that will affect our sequencing， I can't have Bob on two activities at exactly the same time。

 so that affects our sequencing so this helps us to create a logical relationship from the start of the project all the way to the end of the project we'll develop the schedule。

Our Es for scheduled development， there are a lot， so let's walk through these。

Your project management plan， specifically schedule management plan of the scope baseline Project documents will need our activity attributes our activity list。

 the assumption log， the basis of your estimates， your lessons learned。The milestone list。

 your scheduled network diagram。You'll have your team assignments。Resource calendars。

 resource requirements， and the risk register agreements， probably talking about contracts here。

 and then EEF and OPA。Tols and techniques， we need schedule network analysis。

 and that's what we're getting ready to do。The critical path method。Resource optimization。

Data analysis， here's where we do some what if scenario analysis， leads and lags。

Schedule compression， your PMMIS， and we'll do agile release planning。

My outputs of developing the schedule， I have a schedule baseline， I have the project schedule。

 schedule data。Project calendars， change request， you have updates to your project management plan。

 your schedule management plan， your cost baseline。

Updates to project documents like the activity attributes， the assumption log。

Lessons learned register， resource requirements and the risk register。

 so a lot of input tools and techniques here will developed the schedule so we're going to hop in now and really look at these tools and techniques so keep going we're going to dig into this in the very next lecture。
