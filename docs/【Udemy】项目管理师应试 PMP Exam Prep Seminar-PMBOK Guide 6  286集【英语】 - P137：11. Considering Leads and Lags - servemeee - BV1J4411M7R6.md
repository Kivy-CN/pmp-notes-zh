I mentioned leads and lags a little bit earlier in this section。

 but it's really important to have a good grasp on what's a lead and what's lag because you will see some questions on these for your exam。

These are values that you add to an activity to change or affect its start time。

So lead time and lag time lag time is positive time that you're taking that start time and you're moving it away from its scheduled start time leadad time is negative time that you're taking that start time and you are subtracting。

 you're moving it closer to the project start time。

So it's done on an activity that you're moving an activity， you're delaying it。

 or you are increasing， you are moving it closer to where we are today。

So sometimes lead is called accelerated time lead can even allow activities to overlap。

Lag time is just the opposite， it's waiting time， it moves activities further apart。

 so lead time and lag time。Let's take a look at our lead time。Procurement takes 30 days。

 We've already talked about this， right，30 days for procurement。 You need your cabinets in 45 days。

 So on day 15， you order the cabinets to have them delivered on day 45。

 So it's a way of saying that I don't start that process on day 45。

 It's as if I need the cabinets on day 15。 So I have a lead time for my cabinet delivery of 45 days。

 even though it will take 30 days to get out there。 So on day 15， I have 30 days。

 I need them on day 45。 I don't need them today。 I can't really just stick them somewhere。

 there're going be someone's gonna steal them or get damaged。 I want them delivered on day 45。

 So it's as if I'm coming back in time as if I need them today。

Even though it takes 30 days to get here。 So lead time is anytime you move activities closer。

 It's negative time because you're coming back into the schedule 30 days in this instance。

30 days from day 45 is when you start the。Cabinet delivery or cabinet procurement activity。

Another lead time example here is with painting so we're going to paint a big hotel room。

 the priming crew they start on day one and as soon as they're finished then we can start painting so we have a finish to start prime to paint so technically the painting crew can chase the priming crew around so they can have a lead time of 19 days I don't have to have all of the rooms primed in order to start painting so on my painting activity it's scheduled to start on day 20 but really it can start one day after all of these activities are done。

So even though it is a finish to start， I can say minus 19 days to start。19 days sooner than day 20。

 so it can chase the primers through the hotel。Lag time is anytime you're waiting so you're waiting for materials to cure like paint or concrete or do you have to wait for something to calm down or to cool off or whatever the case may be in your waiting time it's plus time so you take a start date you could add plus two to it and that pushes it out so lag time increases duration lead time reduces duration of the whole project it's a schedule compression technique。

So know those terms for your exam， lag and lead lead。Negative time， lag， positive time。 All right。

 good job。 I'll see you in the next lecture。
