。Let's take a look at what goes into the risk management plan and how it's created。First off。

 in order to create the risk management plan， I need a lot of people to help。Obviously。

 the project managers involved and the project team leads your key stakeholders are involved。

 you may have some organizational。People that can help some personnel from like a risk management department。

And then you may also have management or persons of authorities that can help with this type of decision making。

The risk management planning we're going to really nail down well what are the planning activities we're required to do what's the cost and schedule to do risk management activities so we're talking about quantitative analysis that takes time and money often to do that and then that also sets us up for our risk responses we'll see that a little bit later in the section。

What will be the assignment of risk responsibilities so will you be creating risk owners and what does that mean to be a risk owner。

 how will that individual track that risk and monitor and report on that risk and be empowered to respond with a risk？

What about templates， so do you have types of categories like hardware。

 software network data that are some templates for risk categories that are just always types of risk that you have in your discipline。

 so in healthcare or manufacturing or know whatever type of business that you operate in。

What are the different definitions for level of risk like very high to very low or what does moderate mean？

And then how will you create and define your probability at impact matrices so we'll be creating a risk impact matrix coming up。

 so this is part of our plan though it defines how will you do that and what does it mean to have a probability impact matrix where you operate。

Also in our plan is how will you do risk identification。

 this is an ongoing iterative activity we always want to look for risk events and how they could threaten our project so or opportunities。

 you know we often think of the negative side here。

How you do qualitative and quantitative analysis in your project， often the project priority。

We'll guide you on qualitative and quantitative analysis if it's needed into what depth。

And we'll talk about that， of course， in this section。

Resources and funds that may be needed to actually implement the plan and then how you schedule these activities and what are the different risk categories that you foresee in your project and that can set us up for that risk breakdown structure。

Also in the plan， have you defined the risk appetite so you think about opportunities and risk and reward？

What are the documentations and reports you'll be creating risk reports so do you have a template for that and what is the nomenclature that you use where you work and what does a risk report look like？

How will you do planning， so we need to dig in and do risk response planning after we do quantitative analysis。

How will you monitor and track risk events and ongoing risk management activities？

Your organization may have a methodology for how you do risk management for how you do planning so we need to understand what that methodology is and is it documented and then that's something that we insert into our risk management plan So what are the tools that your organization will use What is the approach that happens in your organization what's the data sources if you have historical information and some good knowledge management and then what's the approach for your type of project in your phase So different phases could introduce different types of risk about foundation framing。

 electrical and so on and then how flexible is your project。

 how resilient is it when these risk if they do happen can you flex and adapt and then attack those risk events So this is a lot of information it's part of your risk management plan so you should be familiar with that for your exam。
