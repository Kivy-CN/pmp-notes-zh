As we're in planning and talking about risk management。

 we also need to be aware of some policies that you have to adhere to from different levels of your organization so in this table we have senior level and management level in support level and each one of these levels has some input into the policies that you have to follow in risk management。

So first off， let's talk about just the policy at a senior level with the policy。

 they're developing the risk management policy， so what are the rules and what's the approach to risk that fits in with the management strategy。

 the vision of your organization。Now at the management level is the actual implementation of that policy。

 so they are implementing plans， they're prioritizing， and they are implementing that policy。

At the support level， we're supporting the policy， so it's all about explaining the roles and the benefits。

 and then how do you actually implement the policy？Now at the senior level。

 what's the senior level roles and responsibility， it's all about defining the accountabilities and methodologies in risk management。

At the management level， it's implementation， so the implement that policy and then you can see at the support level。

 we are advising on how to use the right tools that will be in sync with the overall policy for risk management。

Resources， the senior level can provide resources or they secure commitments so that you have the resources。

 secure commitments and resources to ensure that the risk strategy and the risk policy is followed。

 This goes back like in quality， you say zero defects， I need the mechanisms to make that happen。

 So if you have a risk policy that I'm obliged to meet。

 I need to have the right resources to make that risk policy a reality。At the management level。

 it's reviewing how effective the policy is and then offering some support。

And then at the actual support level is you're analyzing the management information and then creating recommendations to how can we improve upon our policies and procedures so you have these three different layers when it comes to risk management policies。

I wouldn't worry a whole lot about this for your exam。

 I would just be aware that senior level is more like vision and direction。

 management level is a kind of an implementation and ensuring that it's happening the support level is all about I want to make certain that you can get this done that you understand the policy and approach。

Some more here about the risk policy when it comes to organizational process assets。

Your organization might have a predefined approach that this is how you plan。

 this is how you identify， this is how you analyze， and these are the responses that we use。

 and then of course how do you track all that through your project。

You want to map out the risk management to these policies。

 so whatever the policies are in your organization， this is how you identify and so on。

 you would ensure that your plan includes those activities。

You have to identify any risk that could hinder your success。

 so we'll talk more about that in risk identification and then the risk policy is part of OPA。

 it's been created for you to describe how you operate in the project。Some more OPAs。

 so the risk categories and a risk breakdown structure， so we'll talk about categories of risk。

 the breakdown structure is like the WBS and the resource breakdown structure。

 it's all of the parts of your project like an org chart and then where do the risk exist within these different components。

What are the definitions for your risk concepts and terms， So in your organization。

 you may have specific terms that is how you grade risk， like very low to very high。

 Well what does it mean to be very high， How do you qualify for very high or you might say that you have a。

You know， a special risk， you may have a noneven risk， you may have a variable risk。

 but what does that mean so everyone understands what these risks are and what does it mean in your project。

How do you document the risk， do you just write them in a list。

 do you have a special form that you use to capture it when you put them into what's called the risk register。

 what characteristics， what's the statement that you'll write to describe the risk event？

Does your organization have templates already for this process， a risk management plan。

 a risk register， even a risk report， they may have templates created for you。

 or you take historical information and adapt it to your current project？

What roles and responsibilities exist， how much authority do you have as the PM or your project team to respond to risk events。

 and then what about lessons learned， do you have previous projects or a lessons learned repository that you can pull from to better manage risk events。

We're going to meet a lot when it comes to risk identification and risk analysis so what are these planning meetings and these analysis meetings that we'll see coming up Well the project manager。

 the team and a key stakeholders meet to discuss the risk to discuss the impact of the risk and it may even be to test the risk like you're going to go out and try to recreate it so you have a lab set up or a workspace set up where you can test some of the materials or test the experience to see if the risk event is likely to happen so you're going do some analysis well you want people involved there to get their different points of view to have the experts to actually make that scenario happen。

How much will that cost though so there might be a budget set aside for risk analysis so if you're using a new piece of material rather than go put it right into production。

 you might set up a test or a little lab where you want to see how it works and learn about it。

 what risk are there so you're studying that where you have to pay for that time。

 pay for that material， maybe even pay for the space or the equipment that you use just to do the analysis。

And then that could also affect our schedule and then as we create risk events or I should say risk responses for risk events。

 that could affect our schedule as well because we're responding and that takes time or if a risk event happens or looks like it's going to happen then we may have to change our schedule to accommodate that risk all of this is documented in the risk management plan because it defines how will you identify how will you do qualitative and quantitative analysis how will you create risk responses and then how will you implement the responses and control and track and monitor risk events All right good job keep moving forward。
