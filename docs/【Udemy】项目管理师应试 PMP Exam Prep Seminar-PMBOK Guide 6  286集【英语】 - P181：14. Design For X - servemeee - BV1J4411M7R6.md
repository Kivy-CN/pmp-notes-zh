A new term in the Pimbaok Guide6 edition is design for X。

 sometimes called DFX Design for X is a philosophy and product design that means we're going to take the most important attribute。

 whether that's excellence or reliability or throughput。

 and that's what we're building our whole design around。

 so it's the specific characteristic of a solution。

 so it's what we're designing everything for is the ability to do this one particular solution。

As I mentioned， design for X can also be called DfX。

 The X is some variable that you're trying to address。 The generic one is just excellence。

 but you might be cost or uptime， return on investment。

 your goal here is to identify what's the most important element or solution。

 and then you build around that。 So how do the other components affect the X variable。

The goals are typically lowered cost， improved service， reliability， safety， just overall quality。

 that's designed for X。Now， T 2 designed for X， we might have some problem solving techniques。

 so some approaches here you want to define the problem。Define your root cause， generate a solution。

Select the best solution for that problem and then you implement your solution and then you verify how effective that solution was。

 so define it， then define the root cause， solution， select it， implement it， and then verify。Okay。

 that's designed for X and a little bit of problem solving， I'll see you in the next lecture。
