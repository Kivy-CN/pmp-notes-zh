Quality is important in all projects， whether you're predictive or adaptive。

 we need to know some nuances， though that happen when it comes to adaptive environments an adaptive environments。

 remember that the requirements are based on this product backlog that can be prioritized before we go into each iteration so our goal is to meet the project requirements but it's the requirements for our current iteration。

 so we have a product backlog and that we have what be called an iteration backlog or a sprint backlog that are the things we are to create during the current work period during the current iteration or sprint。

Project requirements are defined in each iteration planning session。

 so what's going to go into this next iteration， that's the grooming of the product backlog。

We do this directly before the team starts the work of the current iteration。Once we're in motion。

 once the team goes into that iteration， there are no changes for that iteration that are allowed。

 no changes to requirements that are allowed at that time。

Some other considerations for adaptive environments。

 the product owner and the development team really work together and they look at the product backlog and they gauge how much labor it will take to create a given chunk of those requirements in the current iteration。

 So we have user stories and one approach is to use what's called user points or story points so that the stories have X amount of points and we can only do X amount of points in this iteration so it's a way to size the number of requirements that we can take on so we don't want to over promiseise and then under deliverli。

 We want to give exactly what we can create in the current iteration。The team， the product owner。

 and the project manager， they all work together because they want to know exactly what these user stories。

 what exactly them to create， so that helps gauge how much work can be done in the current iteration。

Now， quality reviews are built into the agile process or the adaptive process。

 so quality is part of the process and at the end of each iteration there's a meeting called a retrospectivetive。

 the retrospective is we're looking back on the last iteration and we're doing this with the project team and the project manager。

So we're saying what did work or what didn't work and how can we improve upon that。

 so it helps the team and the manager make any adjustments to processes。

 so in future iterations we have a better opportunity of being successful。

It also helps with the improvement to the execution of the work， like， okay， we took on too much。

 We were too aggressive in the amount of user stories that we could do in one iteration。

 So in the next iteration， let's be a little bit more conservative， a little bit more realistic。

All right， so those are all some facts that you need to know when it comes to adaptive environments and quality。
