。🎼Yeah。🎼嗯。Our last process to look at in the knowledge area of resource management is to control resources we talk about controlling resources。

 a lot of this is dealing with physical resources because we're controlling access and the security of those resources we want to think about what happens if a resources delayed to the job site。

 what ripple effect or risk will that introduce。I want to control resource allocation。

 who has access to those resources， when are they used in the project， so resource allocation。

What about defective resources so if I get a defect， how do I control that。

 how do I manage that defective resources， I return it to a vendor。

 but how long will it take to get a replacement？And there are some human and physical concerns so you think about human resources and physical resources people are using the resources。

 so training security access， permission， knowledge。

 the competency level those are all things to consider when we think about human resources working with the physical resources Let's check out these EOs for control resources。

 a whole bunch of inputs here， the project management plan， your resource management plan。

 project documents like your issue log， the lessons learned register， physical resource assignments。

 the project schedule， resource breakdown structure， resource requirements and the risk register。

Work Per data， agreements and OPA。Tools and techniques， data analysis， so alternatives analysis。

 cost benefits， analysis， performance reviews and trend analysis We'll do some problem solving。

 interpersonal and team skills。We're talking about negotiating and influencing。

 And then our PM can help control resources。 My outputs here。 I have work， performance information。

Change Re， project management plan updates， you'll be updating the resource management plan。

 the scheduleed baseline， and the cost baseline。Updates to project documents， the As log。

 the issue log， the lessons learned register， physical resource assignments。

 a resource breakdown structure， and you might update the risk register。

Some very specific activities to know for controlling resources monitor resource expenditures。

 how much are you paying， are you having waste， is there scrap， well that adds up。

Identifying and dealing with any shortages or surpluses because we know that can create some issues in the project and our schedule。

Ensuring that resources are used according to the plan。

Informing appropriate stakeholders when we have an issue with a resource。

 so that might be procurement， might be the functional manager。

 whatever your enterprise or environmental factors are。

What about influencing factors that could affect change in our resources and then when there is a change。

 how do we manage it， that it's going to go through integrated change control。

 and that we have to get that into the plan and reflect that change， so that might mean rework。

 it might mean incorporating the change because it's already done into the project。

There are six steps for resource management problem solving， so step one， identify the problem。

 be very specific， what is the problem， step two， define it。

 break it down into manageable components。And then we investigate it， gather data。Analyze that data。

 so this probably means RCA that root cause analysis。Then we will solve the problem。

 so what's the solution， let's pick one， don't get caught analyzing for weeks on end。

 get to a solution。And then step 6， has it fixed a problem or not， If it has not。

 we start the process over。 So this is all about resource management， problem solving。🎼All right。

 great job， keep moving forward， I'll see you in the next lecture。
