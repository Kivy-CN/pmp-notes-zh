For your exam you'll need to be able to recognize the concept of naturally developing project teams This is the idea that teams move through a process and identify leaders and followers So is based on Bruce Tuckman's Tman's team development model sometimes called Tuckman's ladder it's the five phases to team development so let's look at that now。

It's the idea of forming， storming， norming， performing， and then adjourning。

Forming happens when the team comes together， so they first meet they just have some high level formations that very quick。

 polite meetings。Storming， though， is where people begin to position themselves to be a leader or a follower。

 they feel very strongly about parts of the project。

 so you might have some hostility towards one another or even the project manager。

Noring is where people accept their roles and people begin to follow and lead based on the outputs of storming。

 and this is where they start to rely on one another and complete their project assignments。

And then performing here at the pininnacle is where the team becomes cohesive and they perform well and they're really getting the work done and they work well together and the focus is on getting things done and they really start to enjoy each other and accomplish the goals of the project。

And then of course， when the project is done， we have this fifth layer， which is kind of sad。

 it's adjourning because the team is temporary and they go on to other activities。So for your exam。

 you'll want to know the characteristics of forming， storming， norming， performing。

 and adjourning that the team is disbanded。Okay， that's Tuckman's team development model。

 Let's look at some general management skills now。With general management skills。

 things that you do as a project manager， you have leading that you lead the team。

 you're worried about motivation and direction， aligning people， getting things done。

 but you're motivating people to get things done。Obviously， communicating。

 good project managers are generally good communicators， but remember that half of communication is。

Listening。Some general management skills that you have to have when it comes to team development。

 you have to negotiate， so you're negotiating with functional management with vendors and with your project team members。

 so you're negotiating for things like resources， time， cost， the assignments。

 so you might be negotiating for project team members on what work they can and can't do。

Problem solving the project managers have to have the ability to problem solve。

 so as a project manager you're doing problem solving by passing the PMP exam。

 it showing your critical thinking skills。Influencing that the project managers influence that they used their influence to get things done。

🎼All right， keep moving forward， I'll see you in the next lecture。
