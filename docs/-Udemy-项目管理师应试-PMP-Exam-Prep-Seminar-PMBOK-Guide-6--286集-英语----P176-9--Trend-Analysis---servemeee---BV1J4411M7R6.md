Welcome back， let's talk about trend analysis。A trend is where you begin to notice a pattern and that pattern can predict future results。

Trend analysis can be dangerous， though， because not always will pass performance indicate future performance。

 A great example of this。 If you've ever gone to a casino and looked at the roulette table。

 And they have a little sign there of hot numbers。 So all the numbers that have been hitting。

 And then people will say， oh， well，17 is hitting a lot。 I'm gonna to bet on 17。

 And then it doesn't hit anymore more。 just because it happened in the past doesn't mean it will happen in the future。

 However， if 17 is consistently time after time after time coming up or three out of five times or four out of five times。

 Then that might be a trend， maybe that wheel is slightly off kilter causing the ball to find that side of the numbers。

 Who knows？ But my point being。Past performance does not always predict future performance。

To apply trend analysis， we're talking about technical performance。

 How many errors have you experienced up to this point。 And do you notice a trend。

 as it always with the same type of deliverable or the same type of activities。

How many additional errors are you experiencing since those last errors were addressed。

 So was there a before and after， And so if so， did the errors go down or up or remain the same。

 So that activity you did at corrective and preventive actions you may have taken。

 did they affect the outcome of these new errors you've deducted or that you've analyzed。

So trend analysis， some ways to do trend analysis， cost and schedule is one of the big things we'll do with trend analysis。

 So how many activities were completed incorrectly in this time period。What about the delivery time。

 how long did it take for deliverables or for a vendor and were there cost variances and are we beginning to creep off of our cost baseline and so we're trending consistently trending away as far as cumulative cost for errors。

 Those are the types of trends that we can do pretty accurately in project management。All right。

 so that's trend analysis with quality control。
