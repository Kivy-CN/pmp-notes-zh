„ÄÇNow let's talk about project performance and how we measure it using earned value management„ÄÇ

Earn value management is a suite of formulas that we can use to forecast project performance and to show current project performance„ÄÇ

 You will have a few questions on earn value management on your exam„ÄÇ

 So let's take a look at this now on how we calculate EVM and what EVM is„ÄÇ

 So the foundations here of earn value management„ÄÇWe have a project that has a budget at completion„ÄÇ

 the BAC of $250Ôºå000„ÄÇRight now we are 40% done with this project„ÄÇWe're supposed to be 55% done„ÄÇ

 and we have spent 112000Ôºå and that's called our actual cost„ÄÇWhere we are right now is earned value„ÄÇ

Earned value is 40% of our budget at completion„ÄÇSo EV is percent complete„ÄÇ

Times the budget at completion„ÄÇ So 40% of $250000 is 100000„ÄÇ Our earned value is 100000„ÄÇ

Our planned value is where we're supposed to be at this time„ÄÇ

 so our planned value is 55% and we're of 250000Ôºå so we're supposed to be a worth 137Ôºå500„ÄÇ

 so 55% of 250Ôºå000„ÄÇWe know we have some variances here„ÄÇOur variancesÔºå we have a cost variance„ÄÇ

 and we have a schedule variance„ÄÇThe cost variance is our earned value minus actual cost„ÄÇ

 so earned value is 100Ôºå000Ôºå and we have spent 112Ôºå000„ÄÇSo 100Ôºå000 minus 112Ôºå it's negative 12Ôºå000„ÄÇ

So we have spent more than what our earned value isÔºå we spent more than what we're worth„ÄÇ

Our schedule variants were 40% completeÔºå were supposed to be 55% completeÔºå so it's earned value„ÄÇ

 minus plan valueÔºå 100Ôºå000 minus 1375Ôºå negative 37Ôºå500Ôºå so that's our schedule variance„ÄÇNext„ÄÇ

 let's look at measuring performanceÔºå so this is where we create indexes„ÄÇ

 and index is always something divided by something„ÄÇSo in this example„ÄÇ

 we want to see how well are we performing on time and how well are we performing on cost„ÄÇ

 so first let's look at cost„ÄÇIts earned value divided by actual cost will tell us our cost performance index„ÄÇ

The closer to one we areÔºå the better we're performing on cost„ÄÇSo in this exampleÔºå it's 100„ÄÇ

000 that's our earned value„ÄÇDivided by our actual costÔºå112000„ÄÇ So „ÄÇ89 not doing great on cost here„ÄÇ

 So we have spent more than what we're worth„ÄÇ you could say that for every„ÄÇDollar we spend„ÄÇ

 We lose about 11 cents„ÄÇSo that's not good„ÄÇ The closerer the oneÔºå the better we are„ÄÇ

Are schedules doing even worseÔºüOur schedule performance index is our earned value divided by planned value„ÄÇ

 So 100000 divided by 1375„ÄÇ It's about 0„ÄÇ73„ÄÇSo you are roughly 27% off schedule here„ÄÇ

 so we're not doing too great„ÄÇ so the closer the one you areÔºå the better you should be„ÄÇ

 the better you are doing„ÄÇBased on this information„ÄÇ

 we can now do some predictions about how the project is going to end up„ÄÇ

 how well the project is going to perform as a whole„ÄÇ

So this is where we create our estimate at completion„ÄÇ

We take our budget at completion and divide by the CPIÔºå so 250Ôºå000 divided by 0„ÄÇ89 is 280Ôºå000„ÄÇ

So right nowÔºå we're losing 11 cents on the dollar„ÄÇ If we continue to lose 11 cents on the dollar„ÄÇ

 if we continue to be at 0„ÄÇ89Ôºå then we are going to have an end of the project at 280000Ôºå30„ÄÇ

000 more than what we are right now„ÄÇNowÔºå the estimate to completeÔºå we can take our EAC of 280„ÄÇ

000 minus how much have we spent alreadyÔºå 112Ôºå000Ôºå and we will need 168Ôºå000 more„ÄÇ

So to keep these two formulas straight and what they're telling us„ÄÇ

The EAC is how much are we going to be at the end of the project based on performance nowÔºü

The ETC is how much more do you need to get to the end of this projectÔºå so right now we need 168„ÄÇ

000 more based on our current performance at 0„ÄÇ89„ÄÇIf our CPI continues to dip„ÄÇ

 that's going to go up and up and up because we continue to spend more than what we are worth„ÄÇ

We have an estimate at completion based on our current cost performance„ÄÇ

 So this is a little variation of EAC„ÄÇ We take our future work is what we're considering here„ÄÇ

 So we're trying to forecast our final project cost„ÄÇBased on our current performance„ÄÇ

So this formula for the EACÔºå we take our actual cost„ÄÇPlus„ÄÇ

 our budget at completion minus earned value„ÄÇSo this is predicting the future„ÄÇ

So are EAC based on current performanceÔºüActual cost was 112000„ÄÇOur budget at completion is 250„ÄÇ

000 minus our earn value of 100Ôºå000 that will be 262Ôºå000„ÄÇ remember our standard formula was 250„ÄÇ

000 divided by 0„ÄÇ89 for 280„ÄÇSo basically what we're saying here is we're going to be able to improve it won't it's still not going to be 250„ÄÇ

000Ôºå but it's not going to be 280Ôºå000„ÄÇ so current performance is what we're after that things are going to improve„ÄÇ

Another approach with EAC is to consider the CPI and the SPI„ÄÇ

So we make it basically a guess that the same efficiency rate is going to happen for time and cost„ÄÇ

We couldÔºå if we wanted monkey around with the CPI and the SI and weight those do like a weighteded average like pert„ÄÇ

For your exam„ÄÇ And for right nowÔºå it's just all the same„ÄÇ we don't have to get crazy with this„ÄÇ

 So our S and CP factorsÔºå this is a pretty convoluted formula„ÄÇ

But it would be our actual cost plus our budget at completion minus earn value divided by CPI times SI and remember your order of operations„ÄÇ

 we start with the parentheses first„ÄÇAnd then we would do the division„ÄÇ

 and then we would add the actual cost„ÄÇSo let's see what that would look like in this example„ÄÇSo„ÄÇ

 we would take„ÄÇ112000 is our actual cost plus 250Ôºå000 minus-100Ôºå000Ôºå divided by 0„ÄÇ89 times 0„ÄÇ73„ÄÇ

So that would be 112 plus 150 divided by 065„ÄÇ So 112 plus 230000„ÄÇOur EAC would be 342Ôºå000 so really„ÄÇ

 really bigÔºå it's saying that your SIÔºå which is really bad and your CPI is not great„ÄÇ

 that that's really going to add up a lot more than you think„ÄÇ

 so you're going to be spending a lot more than just the standard formula„ÄÇ

 a budget at completion divided by CPI„ÄÇSo there are three different formulas here for EAC„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 do you need to know all these if you have timeÔºå sure„ÄÇ

 but most likely will be budget at completion divided by CPI„ÄÇ

Another formula you need to know is the two complete performance index„ÄÇ We're basically asking„ÄÇ

Based on performance nowÔºå can you hit the original budget at completion„ÄÇ

Or is it more likely that you'll hit the new estimate at completionÔºå the new EACÔºü

So the formulas are very simpleÔºå but there's a subtle difference„ÄÇ

 We have the TCPI equals budget at completion minus earn value divided by budget at completion minus actual cost„ÄÇ

But notice the one below itÔºå the second part of the equationÔºå instead of using the BAC„ÄÇ

 we use the EACÔºå the estimate at completion„ÄÇAll rightÔºå let's see what this looks like here„ÄÇ

So we have TCPI„ÄÇBudget at completion minus certain value„ÄÇ

 divided by budget at completion minus actual cost„ÄÇSo this would be 250000100000„ÄÇ

Divided by 250000-112000„ÄÇSo right now that would come out to 1„ÄÇ09„ÄÇ

 So in this example we are above one„ÄÇ so the closer you are or below the more likely you are to hit that value„ÄÇ

 So right now we are 0„ÄÇ09„ÄÇ So it's not very likely we're above one„ÄÇ

 not very likely that we're going to be able to hit our budget at completion„ÄÇ

 because we know that our EAC is 280Ôºå000 and our budget at completion is 250000 So we're spending more based on earned value than what we're really worth because we have an actual cost here and we're supposed to be you know further along in the project„ÄÇ

 So this early on not likelyÔºå so 1„ÄÇ09Ôºå if it's above oneÔºå you're not likely to hit that value„ÄÇ

 So we're not likely to hit our BAC„ÄÇNowÔºå do you think we're going to be able to hit our estimate at completion„ÄÇ

 Our estimate at completion was 280000„ÄÇ So we do the same formula„ÄÇ

 but instead of the BAC for the second halfÔºå we drop in 280„ÄÇ

So our formula then would be 150 divided by 168„ÄÇComes out to 089„ÄÇ

 So this is well below the factor of1 and the farther below you are„ÄÇ

 the more likely it is you'll be able to achieve that factor„ÄÇ So yeah„ÄÇ

 it looks pretty good that we would hit the EACÔºå but not very good that we would hit the BAC„ÄÇ

Allright so those are your earned value management formulas„ÄÇ

 you want to practice those and work on those and in the next lecture I'm going to show you a little spreadsheet that you can follow along with and exercise these and learn these different formulas for your exam All right„ÄÇ

 let's take a look at that now„ÄÇ
