When we do procurement we need to think about the project requirements。

 what are we purchasing and how does that satisfy our project requirements So we'll look at the project scope statement first that defines the high levell requirements and what really defines exactly what we're going to create the project scope statement The work breakdown structure in the WBS dictionary though。

 gives us even more detail down to the work package level So this helps us define what do we need to procure and what are we going to take care of internally in house。

Then we have those documents， the statement of work in the TR。

 the tour So the statement of work and the tour， they describe the work that's going to be accomplished。

 It doesn't describe to find the whole product。 It's just what are we purchasing from the vendor So the entire project could be procured from the vendor or a portion of the project。

 So whatever we're buying， whether it's the whole thing or just this portion of the project。

 that's when we create the statement of work or the tour。

 the terms of agreement orm sorry terms of reference to that portion of the project that we're purchasing。

 So if we are doing a new network upgrade we might need to buy cables and we might want to hire an electrician to do the cabling and to punch down the cables or to create a wi-fi or whatever the case may be we hire someone to do that portion of the project。

 So we wouldn't do a statement of work that。the whole project， it would only be that networking。

 that electrical piece。And then we reference the requirements documentation for what exactly are we buying。

 what exactly has to be satisfied through this contract。A tour here。 some things about the tour。

 So it's a little different term than the statement of work。

 It's what task will the will the contractor complete。 What are the standards are going to fulfill。

 What data。Will the vendor have to provide in order to be approved？

What are all the data and services that are going to be provided by the contractor to the buyer throughout the project？

And then when's the initial submission and how long does it take to review that。

 so we spell that out here in the torque。Okay， so that's all still part of planning。

 so we've got our procurement management plan our SOW or TOR。

 so now we're ready to move forward and to start working on actually procuring。

 so I'll see you in the next lecture。
