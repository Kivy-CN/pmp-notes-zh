üéº„ÄÇSchedule network analysis is a tool and technique to find the earliest and the latest project completion date we're looking for opportunities to delay„ÄÇ

 we're looking for opportunities to shift resources and also doing some sWATÔºå some strengths„ÄÇ

 weaknessesÔºå opportunities and threats analysisÔºå so let's take a look at that now„ÄÇ

What we're talking about in this lecture is finding float„ÄÇ

 There are three types of float you need to be familiar with for your exam„ÄÇ We have free float„ÄÇ

 And that's when an activity can be delayed without delaying your early start„ÄÇ

Of any success or activities„ÄÇTotal float is an activity can be delayed without delaying project completion„ÄÇ

And then project F is a whole project can be delayed without missing your deadline„ÄÇ

 so for example project F your project takes 30 days to do all the work„ÄÇ

 but you have a year to get it doneÔºå so you have a big window there for project float What we're primarily interested in is free float and total float„ÄÇ

Free floatÔºå we're looking at one individual activity and the successor„ÄÇ

Total float is what's the total amount of duration I can have on a task without affecting the end date„ÄÇ

NowÔºå let's look at how to find float„ÄÇ

![](img/d768d7cb005da67cf4f601d332850823_2.png)

So this is a project network diagramÔºå so you can see at these different nodes„ÄÇ

 each one of these nodes represents an activity„ÄÇThe little number you see in the middle that represents the duration„ÄÇ

So what we want to do first when you get one of these questions on your exam is you want to draw it out on a piece of paper„ÄÇ

 don't just stare at the screenÔºå it's too complexÔºå you want to draw this out„ÄÇ

Then the next step that we want to do is find all of the paths and their duration in the project„ÄÇ

So in this exampleÔºå we can go AÔºå BÔºå EÔºå HÔºå JK„ÄÇAnd if we add that upÔºå3 and6 is9„ÄÇ

 I'm adding the duration hereÔºå A is 3Ôºå B is 6Ôºå3 and 6 is 9Ôºå plus 2 is 11„ÄÇ

 plus3 is 14 plus3 is 17 plus2 is 19„ÄÇSo in the lower right hand cornerÔºå we see AÔºå BÔºå EÔºå HÔºå JÔºåK„ÄÇ

 and that's 19 days„ÄÇThen we have the path of AÔºåFÔºå HÔºå JKÔºå and that one takes 22 days„ÄÇ

And then we have the path of ADÔºå DÔºå GÔºå IKÔºå and that takes 21 days„ÄÇ

So it's important to find each one of your paths in the duration„ÄÇ

Because this shows you the critical path„ÄÇThe critical path is the longest path„ÄÇ

 meaning it's the longest in duration in our project„ÄÇ

So the critical path doesn't mean those activities are more important than the other activities„ÄÇ

 it just means that those are activities that cannot be delayed„ÄÇSo are„ÄÇCritical path here is ACFH JK„ÄÇ

 There will be no float on the critical path because rememberÔºå float is an opportunity to delay„ÄÇ

 We can't delay any of those activities or our projects going to be late„ÄÇOn B„ÄÇ

And E and D and G and IÔºå there is an opportunity to delay„ÄÇ

 So that's what we need to do next is find the float on each one of our activities„ÄÇTo do this„ÄÇ

 we'll do a technique that's called the forward pass„ÄÇThe forward passÔºå if you look at activity A„ÄÇ

 begins with the early start„ÄÇPlus the durationÔºå which is represented by D„ÄÇ

inus1 will tell you the early finish Now y minus1Ôºå wellÔºå here's why if you take one plus3„ÄÇ

That will be fourÔºå rightÔºå but if you start work on Monday and you work all dayÔºå Monday„ÄÇAnd all day„ÄÇ

 TuesdayÔºå and all day WednesdayÔºå you've actually worked three daysÔºå not four„ÄÇSo1 plus3 is4„ÄÇ

 minus1 is3„ÄÇSo that's our forward pastÔºå now where do we get one fromÔºü

The first day of the project is day one„ÄÇNow I know some of you know a different way to do this and that's fine use what works„ÄÇ

 the goal here isn't to use my wayÔºå the goal is to answer these questions correctly and pass the exam„ÄÇ

But I prefer this approachÔºå so that's the way I'm going to teach it„ÄÇ

 I think it makes more sense because you always start on day one in a project„ÄÇ

So I'll give a little wink there some of you others though what I'm talking about„ÄÇ

 this is the way you want to do it though so once you do it a couple times you'll be a wizard at this„ÄÇ

So let's look at activity A and we'll follow our formula through hereÔºå so we start on day one„ÄÇ

 one in3 is4Ôºå minus1 is 3Ôºå the earliest you can finish A is day three„ÄÇNow activity B„ÄÇ

 C and D can all start win„ÄÇAs soon as A is doneÔºå so the next dayÔºå so that's why we see for B„ÄÇ

 C and DÔºå they all have their early start as day four because you can start as soon as A is done„ÄÇ

Let's go to activity B„ÄÇ4„ÄÇPlus 6 is 10„ÄÇ-1 is 9„ÄÇ That's the early finish for being„ÄÇActivity C„ÄÇ

4 plus seven days of duration puts us at day 11Ôºå minus-1 is day 10„ÄÇNow activity D„ÄÇ

4 plus 9- 13-1 is 12„ÄÇ so what we've done is we aren't taking one path and just blowing all the way through to the end„ÄÇ

 You have to follow this logical methodical approach because you're only looking at the next successor„ÄÇ

 one successor at a time you can't blow through the whole path and complete it and then come back and say„ÄÇ

 we'll do the next one and the next one„ÄÇYou do one successor at a time„ÄÇSo now let's go to activity E„ÄÇ

Activity E can start as soon as B is doneÔºå rightÔºüSo B ends on day9Ôºå E can start on day 10„ÄÇ

10 and2 is 12Ôºå minus1 is 11„ÄÇActivity F can start as soon as C is done„ÄÇSo it also„ÄÇ

 it can start on day 11Ôºå not alsoÔºå so C finishes on 10Ôºå F can start in 11„ÄÇ

11 plus four days of duration is day 15Ôºå minus1 is 14„ÄÇ

And then drop down to activity G G then can begin as soon as D is doneÔºå so D will end on day 12„ÄÇ

 G can start on day 13„ÄÇThere's only one day of duration for activity GÔºå so 13 and1 is 14„ÄÇ

 you'll also finish on day 13„ÄÇLet's go up now to activity H„ÄÇWhen can activity H start„ÄÇ

 what's its early startÔºüDay 15„ÄÇNot day 12„ÄÇBecause what must be true for H to startÔºüE has to be done„ÄÇ

And F has to be done„ÄÇSo that's where I was saying you can't just blow through the path because if you started at the top and just went all the way through all of those nodes„ÄÇ

 you would probably put activity H could start on day 12 without considering when F would actually finish„ÄÇ

SoÔºå H„ÄÇCan begin on day 15„ÄÇ E and F have to be done„ÄÇ So the greater of the two is day 14„ÄÇ

 which tells me H can start on day 15„ÄÇ15 plus three days of duration is 18 minus1 is 17„ÄÇ

J can begin as soon as H is doneÔºå so its early start is 18„ÄÇ18 and3 is 21Ôºå minus1 is 20„ÄÇ

We go back down to IÔºå I think I skipped I hereÔºå so G is done on 13Ôºå we go the next day is day 14„ÄÇ

 14 and 6 is 20 minus1 is 19„ÄÇNow look at activity K our last activity„ÄÇ

K cannot start until J and I are complete„ÄÇSo the earliest it can begin is day 21 because J finishes on 20„ÄÇ

 I finishes on 19„ÄÇSo K21„ÄÇPlus2 is 23Ôºå-1 is 22„ÄÇNow look at our path duration ACFHJK is 22 days K ends on day 22 if those two numbers don't match if somehow in your math here you came up on day 20 as the last day or day 28„ÄÇ

 you made a math air somewhere„ÄÇThe last numberÔºå the early finish for k has to equal the same duration as the critical path if they don't did some math wrong„ÄÇ

 so double check your math„ÄÇThat's the first part of the equationÔºå all rightÔºå the forward pass„ÄÇ

Now we do the backward passÔºå it's very similarÔºå very similar„ÄÇ

 but now we're going to be minus the duration and adding one day„ÄÇSo we start at the end„ÄÇ

 very similarÔºå we start at the end with K„ÄÇKÔºå our late finish will equal our early finish„ÄÇ

 so our late finish is day 22„ÄÇ if we follow our formulaÔºå late finish minus the duration plus1„ÄÇ

 so 22 minus2 is 20 plus 1 is 21„ÄÇ that's our late start„ÄÇJay has to finish by day 20„ÄÇSoÔºå if we„ÄÇ

Look at day 21 on K„ÄÇThat's the latest it could start to finish the whole project„ÄÇ

So J has to be done by day 20Ôºå but what else is trueÔºüI has to be done by day 20„ÄÇSo J and I„ÄÇ

 the predecessors decay KÔºå can only take day 20 without affecting K„ÄÇ

So Jay's late finishish will be 20 and I's late finish will be 20„ÄÇOn Act J„ÄÇ

 if we do our formula our late finishÔºå minus the duration plus 1Ôºå 20 minus3 is 17 plus 1 is 18„ÄÇ

On activity IÔºå 20 minus6 is 14 plus 1 is 15„ÄÇLet's go to activity H„ÄÇ

 activity H can take all the way out to day 17„ÄÇWithout affecting the late start for J day 18„ÄÇSo H„ÄÇ

 itss late finish is 17Ôºå17-3 is 14 plus 1 is 15„ÄÇActivity E and activity F„ÄÇ

 they can both take out to day 14 without affecting HÔºå so their late finish will both be 14Ôºå 14 on F„ÄÇ

 14 on E on F„ÄÇ14 minus4 is 10 plus 1 is 11„ÄÇOn EÔºå 14 minus2 is 12Ôºå plus 1 is 13„ÄÇLook at activity B„ÄÇ

 you can take all the way out to day 12 without affecting the late start for E„ÄÇ

 so it's one day priorÔºå will be 12„ÄÇ12-6 is 6 plus 1 is 7„ÄÇActivity GÔºå let's hop down the bottom G„ÄÇ

 I can take to 14Ôºå 14 minus-1 is 13„ÄÇ and so its late start will be day 14„ÄÇIn activity D„ÄÇ

I can take out to date 13Ôºå13-9 is4 plus1 is 5„ÄÇNow activity FÔºå I think we did„ÄÇ

 14 minus4 is 10 plus 1 is 11Ôºå and C will be day 10Ôºå 10 minus 7 is 3 plus 1 is 4„ÄÇ

Now look at activity AÔºå Act A has to be done by what day without affecting the successor activities„ÄÇ

Day threeÔºå because it has to finish by day three because C can start no later„ÄÇ

 its late start is day four„ÄÇSo 3 minus3 is0„ÄÇ There's no such thing as day 0„ÄÇ

 so 3 minus3 is 0 plus1 is1„ÄÇAnd that is the backward pass„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 I want you to notice something here on our critical pathÔºå those that have are in blue„ÄÇ

Notice that the late finish„ÄÇIs the same number as the early finish„ÄÇ

And the late start will be the same number or value as the early start„ÄÇSo on the critical path„ÄÇ

 once you know itÔºå a little shortcut you can do on the backward path are just drop those values down„ÄÇ

 they will be the same„ÄÇBecause the difference of our late finish and early finish„ÄÇ

Will will be float and there's no float on the critical path„ÄÇSo let's look at that„ÄÇ

 how do you find floatÔºüYou can take the late finish minus the early finishÔºå and that will show float„ÄÇ

Or you can do the other sideÔºå which will be the late start minus the early start and if you're not a math person„ÄÇ

 that's a great way to check your math is to do both sides„ÄÇ What I mean by both sides is„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå on activity E„ÄÇ14-11Ôºå my late finishÔºå minus my early finishÔºå14-11 is 3„ÄÇ

On the other side of the boxÔºå we have our late startÔºå the early startÔºå13-10 is also 3„ÄÇ

 If those two numbers matchÔºå you knowÔºå your math correct„ÄÇ If they don't match„ÄÇ

 then somewhere there's a mistake„ÄÇ So it'll be the same number on either side„ÄÇ

 whether you're doing the late finish„ÄÇEarly finish or the start side of our node„ÄÇ

So if we plug in that formula that we find our float„ÄÇ

 so let's go through and do this we know on AFH JK is0„ÄÇ

 so if you look at any one of those in blue the difference will always be0 on activity B 12 minus93 so you see the middle node there on the bottom between we have 7312 that three represents float that's where you write in your float„ÄÇ

So 12-9-3 or 7-4 is 3 on activity EÔºå14-11 is 3„ÄÇOn activity DÔºå we have one day afloat on activity G„ÄÇ

 we have one day afloat and on activity IÔºå we have one day afloat„ÄÇSo that's it„ÄÇ

 that's how you find floatÔºå take some practiceÔºå so what type of exam questions will you have here when it comes to floatÔºü

You will likely see a network diagram„ÄÇNot unlike this I mean it's very possible„ÄÇ

 it would be like thisÔºå and then they will ask you if activity D were to take two days of float„ÄÇ

 how much float could you have on activity I„ÄÇSo now you have to do the math to figure out how much float is there and what would it do to the total float for the whole projectÔºü

If you follow this sequenceÔºå we just walk through a lot of times as soon as you find the critical path„ÄÇ

 you can look at the question and then from that you can deduce the amount of float you would have„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå how much float could you have on activity F where you could see it's on the critical path so you get zero float„ÄÇ

 but if we look at activities AÔºå DÔºå GÔºå I or K„ÄÇI only have one day afloat on DÔºå G and I„ÄÇ

Right each day has one day afloat Can I really use one day afloat on DÔºå1 on G and1 on IÔºüI cannot„ÄÇ

 because that path of AÔºå DÔºå GÔºå I and K takes 21 daysÔºå what's the maximum duration for our projectÔºü

22 days„ÄÇSo DÔºå G and IÔºå I can only use one day afloat„ÄÇ so if I use the one day afloat on activity D„ÄÇ

G and IÔºå I can't touch„ÄÇ that's a near critical path„ÄÇ It doesn't mean that it's critical„ÄÇ

 it's near critical„ÄÇ I only have one day afloatÔºå it's really tight here„ÄÇSo on G and I„ÄÇ

 I won't have any float left if I use it on D„ÄÇSo those are the types of questions you'll have let's look at activity B and E here on B you have3 and on E you have three Do you really get six days afloat„ÄÇ

 NoÔºå you have three„ÄÇA quick way you can do this if you find your paths like our very first step„ÄÇ

 so I know you're going to do that„ÄÇYou can very quickly deduce on the activities that are not on the critical path„ÄÇ

 what's them a maximum amount of float you could useÔºüYou have to be careful though„ÄÇ

 because it's the branching like E and F that can affect how much float„ÄÇ

 it won't always be you have3 on B and3 on E„ÄÇ if there was some branching going on here between B and E„ÄÇ

 then that could affect„ÄÇHow much float you get on B„ÄÇ

So you can't just always assume it'll be the same for every activity often it isÔºå but not always„ÄÇ

 so you have to do this floatÔºå so it take some practiceÔºå I know it's tedious„ÄÇAlso„ÄÇ

 know you're not going to have 20 questions on this„ÄÇ You're not going to have 200 questions on this„ÄÇ

 You'll have a few questions about floatÔºå so you need to know how to do it„ÄÇ

 but I wouldn't spend an hour trying to figure this out on your exam„ÄÇ

 Hard questions are worth the same amount as easy questions„ÄÇ All rightÔºå keep going„ÄÇ

 I'll see you in the next lecture„ÄÇ
