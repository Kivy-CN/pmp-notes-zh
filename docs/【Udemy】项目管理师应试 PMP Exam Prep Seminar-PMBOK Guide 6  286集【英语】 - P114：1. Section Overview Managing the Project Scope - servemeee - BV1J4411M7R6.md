Project scope management is one of the most important knowledge areas because without the scope what are we doing in a project we need the scope because it sets the vision for what the project is going to create it's how we move from our current state to that desired future state so in this section we're talking about chapter 5 in the Pimbaokites 6th edition on Project scopepe management。

A lot of important things to talk about in this section， we're going to look at planning。

 creating a scope management plan。We're going to discuss the difference between a project scope and a project scope。

 we're generally interested in just the project scope。

 but we need to understand the project scope because that helps us see into the requirements that will help us build and create the project scope so theres a symbiotic relationship there that we'll look at coming up。

We'll talk about the trends in scope management and how does scope management work in an adaptive environment。

We'll talk about collecting project requirements and managing those requirements and then creating the project scopepe statement。

After we have the scope statement， then we'll create the work breakdown structure of the WBS and the WBS dictionary。

 So some new terms there to watch for in this section。

And I have an assignment for you in this section where you'll create a work breakdown structure。

 so you're going to do a little bit of handson activity that will help reinforce what you've learned or create some clarity into these processes。

We'll talk about validating the project scope and then a little coaching session for you。

 I want to talk to you about controlling your scope。Okay。

 let's hop in here and talk about managing the project scope。
