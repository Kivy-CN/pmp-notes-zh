嗯。Bottom up estimating doesn't mean。

Bottoms up， it means we're starting at the bottom and accounting for all the cost in our WBS。

So it's usually something that was associated with cost just like I said。

 but you could do it with time all right so it's used for resource estimating and used for how long these activities will take you have to have a work breakdown structure to do a bottom up estimate so you have to know exactly the type of resources and exactly what that work package is going to create so you're accounting for the time in this instance later we'll see it works for cost as well。

So each work package， each work package can have multiple activities associated with it。

 so you might have a work package of install the software okay but what does that mean so the activities could be install Microsoft Office。

 installdobe Photoshop， install Google Chrome is we have all these activities that are linked that support the work package of install software。

So those activities then we need to know how long each one of those activities take in order to say how long this work package will take。

So bottom up estimating is also known as a definitive estimate。

 but it takes the longest to create because you have to have a really good WBS and a really good understanding of all of the activities to create the work packages。

Again， it's called bottom up because you're starting at the bottom at the work package and you're working your way up。

 you're looking at the aggregation of all of the time to predict duration for the project。

 so bottom up estimating takes the longest to do， but it is the most reliable。

 you can do this for time and you can do this for cost so you're ahead of the curve you'll see that coming up later in the course。

All right， good job， keep moving forward。
