OkayÔºå we're still hanging out in project integration management„ÄÇ

 We have completed initiation as far as this knowledge area goes„ÄÇ

 and now we're going to go into planning„ÄÇ So we're still in project integration management moving into planning Our process here is to develop the project management plan„ÄÇ

 One thing to be really clear about when it comes to developing the project management plan is this is an ongoing iterative activity on day one„ÄÇ

 you won't have a whole lot of information to plan from But as you go out and talk to customers and stakeholders and you examine requirements and you work with your team„ÄÇ

 You get some clarity„ÄÇ This is part of progressive elaboration„ÄÇ Remember„ÄÇ

 I'm going to build a house for you„ÄÇ Well what kind of house„ÄÇ

 Tell me about the kitchen all the way down to what type of pools do you want of that cabinet door„ÄÇ

 So that's progressive elaboration„ÄÇ As I know more information„ÄÇüòäÔºåI can plan in more detail„ÄÇ

Let's look at the Es to develop the project management plan„ÄÇ You have the project charter„ÄÇ

You get outputs from other processes that's a great example what I was just talking about day one„ÄÇ

 we're not going to have a lot of outputs from other processes as I go out and I do more and more processes that allows me to plan in more detail and then EEF and OPA„ÄÇ

Tools and techniquesÔºå expert judgment„ÄÇData gatheringÔºå so things like brainstorming using checklists„ÄÇ

 focus groups and interviews„ÄÇThere's our interpersonal and team skills because you're going to have conflict management„ÄÇ

 you have to do facilitation and meeting managementÔºå and of course we're going to have meetings„ÄÇ

The only output of developing the project management plan is the project management plan„ÄÇ

So what goes into the plan or why do we have a plan well the project management plan is a document that's fluid meaning it can be updated throughout the project„ÄÇ

It defines how will the project be executedÔºå how will you monitor and control the project„ÄÇ

 and then how will you close out the different phases in the end of the project„ÄÇ

 so it's really a guide it's our prediction of what we're going to do„ÄÇ

As we move through the course you're going to see every knowledge area gets at least one plan„ÄÇ

 so those plans for each knowledge areas are part of this project management plan„ÄÇ

 they're part of this master planÔºå if you willÔºå but we just call it the project management plan„ÄÇ

 they're called subsidiary plans that are specific to that knowledge area„ÄÇSo for example„ÄÇ

 in the next chapterÔºå we're going to see we have a scope management plan and then we have a schedule management plan and a cost management plan and so on„ÄÇ

 those are subsidiary plans that are part of the project management plan„ÄÇOnce we have a plan created„ÄÇ

 once we have this project management plan createdÔºå what we want to do is to create a baseline„ÄÇ

 a baseline is kind of a capture of our intent todayÔºå so this is what we say we're going to do„ÄÇ

 this is locked inÔºå we have approval and agreement on this plan„ÄÇAfter we've got a baseline„ÄÇ

 if there are new changes or new additions to the project or any part of that plan wants to be changed„ÄÇ

 then we have to do change control„ÄÇvery importantÔºå so we have a project plan and a piece of paper„ÄÇ

Could be in Microsoft project or premeviera or Microsoft WordÔºå but somewhere you have the plan„ÄÇ

 you've got a document here„ÄÇWhen management approves it and we're all in agreement„ÄÇ

 this is what we are going to do any change to that plan requires a change request„ÄÇ

 very important to know that we're going to see that throughout the course„ÄÇ

 we're going to see that when the plan needs to be updatedÔºå you get a change request„ÄÇ

So what's the purpose of the planÔºå as I just mentioned it communicates our intent„ÄÇ

 it says why are we doing these activitiesÔºüIt serves as a guide for the project manager„ÄÇ

 It helps refresh memories„ÄÇ It helps to direct and steerÔºå gives us some structure„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

It documents our intent and it gives us a baseline„ÄÇ We get baseline for the project„ÄÇ remember„ÄÇ

 once you have a baseline after thatÔºå you have to do a change request if you want to change the plan„ÄÇ

Who contributes to the planÔºå not just the project managerÔºå we have a lot of different participants„ÄÇ

 yesÔºå the project managerÔºå you have the project team because they're the people closest to the work„ÄÇ

 they're going to be able to help with the timeÔºå the estimating the scheduleÔºå risk assessment„ÄÇ

 things like that„ÄÇCustomers can be involved because they set things like objectives and key requirements„ÄÇ

 they can also have a lot of influence on your budget and your schedule„ÄÇ

Management's involve because they need approvalÔºå so they're going to direct us on things like the budget„ÄÇ

 the resources you can useÔºå what's your PM methodology„ÄÇ

What's the quality requirements and then as I mentionedÔºå they have approval on the plan„ÄÇ

When it comes to planning there is a skill set that we need to have as a PM„ÄÇ

 be familiar with these for your examÔºå so we need to be able to tailor some processes and we'll talk about tailoring in each knowledge area„ÄÇ

I want to be able to develop additional componentsÔºå so those subsidiary plans„ÄÇ

 and there'll be some documents as well„ÄÇI have to be able to determine which tools and techniques are most appropriate for the project„ÄÇ

What about technical and management details so like my project teamÔºå subject matter experts„ÄÇ

 so I need to understand the technology and then the management of that technology„ÄÇ

What resources and skills are neededÔºüWhat level of configuration management is appropriateÔºü

Configuration management is all about documenting and controlling the features and functions of the product scope„ÄÇ

What project documents have to go through formal change control so this is an important part as well we talked about that baseline so also in the project we'll create baseline for our scope for our schedule for our budget but you might have some other things in there so you might have like even the risk register you might have the stakeholder register that are baseline meaning that they're kind of locked in and if there's going to change there's a process to change those you have to follow„ÄÇ

So we'll see formal change control the big one of courseÔºå is scope and schedule and cost„ÄÇ

 some of those others may be a little bit more relaxed when it comes to change control„ÄÇ

And then prioritizing workÔºå what's most important down to least important„ÄÇ

 so what should you focus on when it comes to project successÔºü

In project planning we're going to do some data gatheringÔºå so brainstorming„ÄÇ

 we're going to use some checklistÔºå remember those focus groups we talked about with the charter so we can do focus groups here for data gathering for planning and interviews„ÄÇ

 you got to get out and talk to people„ÄÇYou will have meetings„ÄÇ

 we do a lot of meetings in project management„ÄÇSo we want to discuss the project approach„ÄÇ

 how are we going to go about planning so a methodology for planning or exactly what needs to be planned and then we want to document things so we think about writing this up on a whiteboard taking photos of plans„ÄÇ

 making sure someone's keeping the minutesÔºå so document what happens in the meeting and then of course we follow up with the minutes and action items very important to do that„ÄÇ

A kickoff meeting kickoff meetings are a real signal that we're done with planning and now we go into execution now I know some of you out there do a kickoff meeting way back as soon as the charter is done and I've been an organization that that's just the way we do it„ÄÇ

For your exam and in the Pimbaok guide the kickoff meeting is after the project plan is approved it's not when the charter is approved after the plan is approved„ÄÇ

 we do the kickoff meeting the kickoff meeting is a way to get everyone together„ÄÇ

 kind of get them excitedÔºå get some buy in here and really communicate what we aim to do and then we go around the room and we talk about the different stakeholders and what their roles and responsibilities are that everybody's clear everybody hears the same message about roles and responsibilities and what we're trying to do in this project„ÄÇ

Kickoff meetings and project size„ÄÇ All rightÔºå so there is a little flex here when it comes to how formal this kickoff meeting needs to be a small project„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå planning and execution„ÄÇOur overlap pretty quickly in a smaller project„ÄÇ

 so the kickoff could occur after initiation in planning„ÄÇ So I know I just saidÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 typically I've been in organizations where we have the charter and then we go into initiation„ÄÇ

 but a smaller projectÔºå I may not have to be so formalÔºå so it could be„ÄÇIn the planning process„ÄÇ

 we kick it off now let's get to work„ÄÇLarger projectsÔºå the project team does the planning„ÄÇ

And then the team is brought on when initial planning is complete„ÄÇ

 So what I'm saying here is you may have a project management team„ÄÇ

So like the PMO or a group of executives and business analysts that they plan everything out„ÄÇ

 so I work with the project managerÔºå I work with business analysts„ÄÇ

 I work with these executives and the PMO and we plan out the whole project and then we bring on the project team and tell them this is our plan and how we're going to do it„ÄÇ

So you could imagine„ÄÇYou're building a house and you've got framers„ÄÇ

 the framers don't need to be there in the planning necessarilyÔºå so the project manager„ÄÇ

 you know the architectÔºå the professional engineer and whomever they may create the plan why the framers are out working on another job right now so we have the plan created then we meet with the framers and we say this is what we're going to create this is what you're going to do so at a larger project the PM team„ÄÇ

 the project management team could do the planning„ÄÇNow multiphase project„ÄÇ

 a really large multiphase projectÔºå you could do a kickoff at the start of each phase„ÄÇ

 so those are some things that could happen with kickoff meetings„ÄÇ

Let's look at what's in a typical project management plan„ÄÇ

 we've got a lot of things here in the project management plan„ÄÇThe scope management plan„ÄÇ

 How will you define the scope and develop itÔºå Mon and control it and do scope validation„ÄÇ

 We'll see that plan in Chapter 5 in the Pimmbok„ÄÇ The requirements management plan„ÄÇ

 How will you gather requirementsÔºå How will they be documented and managed„ÄÇ Also„ÄÇ

 Chapter 5 in the Pimmbok„ÄÇSchedule management plan„ÄÇ

 So how are you going to define and control the scheduleÔºå so that's chapter 6 in the Pimba guide„ÄÇ

Cost management plan„ÄÇ How will cost be plannedÔºå structuredÔºå estimatedÔºå controlled„ÄÇ

 That's Chapter 7 of the Pibook„ÄÇ The quality management plan„ÄÇ

 So how will this project adhere to our quality policies„ÄÇ

 What methodologies do you do for quality assurance and quality control And how are you going to implement those„ÄÇ

 AndÔºå of courseÔºå quality is Chaer 8 in the Pibaok„ÄÇResource management„ÄÇ

 so how will resources be categorizedÔºå how you get them on your teamÔºå how will you manage them„ÄÇ

 how will you release resourcesÔºå remember resources are peopleÔºå materialsÔºå toolsÔºå equipment„ÄÇ

 things like thatÔºå not only people so we have physical resources and that's chapter9 in the pinmbaok„ÄÇ

Communications Cha 10Ôºå our communications management plan„ÄÇ

 so how will you create the information and distribute itÔºüHow will it be disseminated„ÄÇ

 Who has rights to itÔºü So basicallyÔºå you're saying who needs what informationÔºå When do they need it„ÄÇ

 What modalityÔºå How will you secure itÔºå How will you archive and retrieve itÔºü

 So that's all in Chapter 10 of the Pimbaok„ÄÇRisk chapterpt 11Ôºå so how will you identify risk„ÄÇ

 how will you analyze riskÔºå how will you create risk responses and track those risks„ÄÇ

Procurement management plan„ÄÇChapter 12 in the Pimbaok so how you acquire goods and services so what are you allowed to do a lot of enterprise environmental factors here when it comes to procurement and then also how will you do contract administration„ÄÇ

And the last thing that we see here in chapter 13 as far as the Pimbaok goes is stakeholder engagement plan„ÄÇ

 so how will you engage stakeholders and then improve their engagement or maintain their engagement so these are the typical parts of the project management plan„ÄÇ

Your project plan will also include some baseline„ÄÇ remember a baseline is kind of a snapshot of where we are right now„ÄÇ

 so some baselines that we need to know we have a scope baseline„ÄÇ

 a scope baseline is really three different documentsÔºå so we have the scope statement„ÄÇ

 the work breakdown structure and the WBS dictionary and we'll really dive into that in the next section when we talk about scope management„ÄÇ

Then we have the schedule baselineÔºå the schedule baseline is just our schedule model„ÄÇ

 it's what where we say this is how we get from the start all the way to the end„ÄÇ

So this is the flow of the work and how we get all these activities done to hit this target end date„ÄÇ

 so that's our schedule baseline„ÄÇThe cost baseline is a time phase project budget„ÄÇ

 so it's basically saying here's how much the project will cost to get from the start all the way to the end„ÄÇ

 but this is when you can expect to spend the monies to get to the end so it's not just 180Ôºå000„ÄÇ

 it would say this is how much you're going to spend for phase one„ÄÇ

 this is how much you'll spend for phase twoÔºå phase threeÔºå all the way to the end„ÄÇ

 which will equal $180Ôºå000Ôºå that's a cost baseline„ÄÇSome other items that go into our project plan„ÄÇ

 we have a change management planÔºå so how are changes allowed and controlled„ÄÇ

 the configuration management planÔºå how will we controlÔºå documentÔºå review„ÄÇ

 and allow changes to the product scopeÔºå the features and functions of what we're delivering in this projectÔºü

The performance measurement baseline is really the three scope schedule and cost to show overall project performance„ÄÇ

 the performance measurement baseline„ÄÇYou also have a description of the project lifecycle„ÄÇ

 are you doing a predictive life cyclee where upfront you plan everything and these are the known phases or are you doing an adaptive life cyclee where you're using iterative or incremental or scrum or XP„ÄÇ

 so what's the process look like for that type of a life cycleÔºüThe development approach again„ÄÇ

 so describe your development approach with predictiveÔºå iterativeÔºå agile or some hybrid method„ÄÇ

Management reviews at what point throughout the project will management look at and review progressÔºü

Project documents„ÄÇ OkayÔºå I'm not going to read all these to you„ÄÇ That doesn't do you any good„ÄÇ

 but you can see there are a lot of project documents As we move through the course„ÄÇ

 we're going to see all of these„ÄÇ So each knowledge area will create some project document„ÄÇ

 So just go ahead and„ÄÇThink of any knowledge area„ÄÇ Think of quality„ÄÇ Well if you skim over this„ÄÇ

 you're going to seeÔºå okayÔºå there are some documents related to quality„ÄÇ Let's think about resources„ÄÇ

 So if you lookÔºå there's a resource breakdown structure and calendars and requirements„ÄÇ

 Every knowledge areaÔºå Chapters 4Ôºå the Pembaok guideÔºå all the way to Chapter 13Ôºå the pembaok guide„ÄÇ

Create project documents„ÄÇSo you will need to know theseÔºå but it's really not just memorization„ÄÇ

 you're going to need to know how to apply them and what they're used for so they are part of the project management plan„ÄÇ

 but really it's about using those at the right place in the right time we're going to see as we go into each knowledge area„ÄÇ

 those EOs we'll be using different project documents Often we'll see as an output we'll see project document updates„ÄÇ

 so this is what we're updating the relevant project documents„ÄÇü§¢ÔºåAll right„ÄÇ

 good job that was all about the project planÔºå keep moving forwardÔºå I'll see you in the next lecture„ÄÇ
