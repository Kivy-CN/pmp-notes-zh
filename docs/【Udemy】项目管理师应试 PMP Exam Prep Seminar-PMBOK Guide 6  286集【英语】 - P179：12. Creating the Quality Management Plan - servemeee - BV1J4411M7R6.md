Now let's talk about one of the primary outputs of planning for quality， the quality management plan。

 the quality management plan defines how will you control quality。

 how are you going to go out and monitor the results of what you've created for quality standards so poor results we might need root cause analysis so why are we having these poor results。

Quality control， or the process is technically called control quality。

 is all about inspecting what's been created。Managing quality is your performance has to meet quality standards。

 so you want to do the work correctly， this is our QA activities。

 quality assurance activities QA is typically a managerial process that it's built into the work。

 it's built into the approach。Quality improvement are corrective actions。

 You have to fix the problems。 Now， it's interesting。

 improvement will depend on a quality philosophy in the organization。

 So what's the attitude towards quality， What does quality mean in your organization that affects our quality management plan and how we do the work。

Within the quality management plan， we have our quality standards。

 we have our objectives for quality， what are the roles and responsibilities of quality。

 who will test and inspect， who will help implement the work correctly the first time。

 so what are the roles and responsibilities。What deliverables and processes will we review for quality。

What tools do we have available？And dealing with nonconformance。 so we have corrective actions。

 we have continuous improvement procedures so that poor quality or failure， how do you respond to it。

 How do you react to it and recover from that and keep your project moving forward。

Also in the quality management plan， we have metrics， those metrics， as I mentioned。

 and we're talking about the project or a characteristic of the product。

 how well something should conform so that goes back to our requirements。

 we need to know what is good， what is fast， what is reliable and that sets us up for our targets to have these quality metrics。

 we have something to measure。Quality control is used。

 remember it's inspection driven and our goal here is to verify compliance。

 so the process of control quality。 we're looking at things like what tasks were finished on time。

 What's our failure rate， how many defects happened in a given time period， What's our downtime。

 How many errors did you find and what about customer satisfaction scores。

 So it's not just inspecting the deliverable， but also how we got to that deliverable。All right。

 that's the quality management plan。
