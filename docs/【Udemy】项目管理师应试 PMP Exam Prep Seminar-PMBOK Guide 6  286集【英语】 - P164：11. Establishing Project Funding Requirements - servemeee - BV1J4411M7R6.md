We need to be able to predict to communicate when we expect to spend money in our project and this is to establish our project funding requirements the cost baseline is one of those tools we can use to help determine when we're going to be spending money。

Typically it's tied to the phases or milestones or capital expenses like a big purchase for a piece of equipment。

Project funding requirements， we often map that to the schedule because we want to communicate when we need these cash outlays。

 and then this introduces a concept called project step funding。

Let's look at all of this business in motion here。So if you remember in the earlier lecture。

 we saw this， we saw the red line was our actual cost and we had our expenditures and the blue line was our predicted cost。

 our cost baseline。 What's changed here now is notice the stair steps。

 the stair steps represent the funding at different points in the project。

So the very first stair step。Takes us to the end of phase one。And so that is a step funding。

 So based on what we did in the first phase， we get another infusion of funds to go to the second phase and so on。

 the second phase， we finish it， we get more money to go to the third phase and the height of each step represent the amount of money we're going to spend as part of the cumulative value。

 our cumulative cost。So as we have large capital expenditures， we might have a bigger step。

 at least on our curve here， that shows we have spent more money or we anticipate to spend more money。

So this is the cost performance baseline with step funding requirements。At the end of a phase。

 recall as a phase gate， the phase gate is a way to examine what happened in this phase before you can go on to the next phase。

 so a phase gate is also an opportunity to do phase gate estimating where we estimate the cost and sometimes the time to complete the next phase of the project。

A phase gate is also called a stage gate。It might also be called a kill point。

A kill point means it's an opportunity to kill the project。

So if we go back and we look at our cost baseline， you can see that we have these opportunities to kill the project based on poor performance。

 so instead of a step funding to go up， we might say you're not doing too well。

 we're not going to invest any more money into this so we're going to kill the project will cancel the project。

Not a very nice term right， but it's one that you want to know。

 hopefully not one that you ever hear in your career。All right， good job， keep moving forward。
