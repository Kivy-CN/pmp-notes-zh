嗯。Let's talk about quality and grade there is a real difference between quality and grade and sometimes it's easy to get these mixed up。

Quality is all about fulfilling requirements。 So we're talking about meeting the project scope。

 creating the product scope exactly as it was requested。 We have implied needs there。

 Low quality is always a problem when it comes to our project。

Now grade is a category or a ranking of products of materials of processes or services。

 so we have a ranking like first class versus coach， like plywood versus oak so it's a ranking。

 they're both wood but they have different technical specifications about how we're going to use that thing and its characteristics。

 that's a grade。Low grade may be needed， maybe you need plywood because it's a short term temporary solution。

Low grade isn't necessarily a problem。 Low quality is always a problem。So on your exam。

 when you're talking about different types of material and how one is preferred over the other。

 but you can't afford it。Well， if you're talking about a ranking of materials。

 we're talking about grade if we're talking at about a specific type of material that's required。

 we have to have that type of material in order to meet requirements。

 so we're talking about quality about having the correct material。

 the correct tools and equipment and resources that's all tied to quality。

 but the ranking of that stuff is tied to grade， so quality and grade go together but there is a difference。
