As a project manager， one of the favorite parts about managing a project is team building activities。

 gives us an opportunity to facilitate team development。

 to get people to learn about each other and to come together as a team， and I think they're fun。

So some team building activities are often offsite like you might go bowling or putt put or you go to some type of a seminar or conference that's just for team building there's all sorts of companies out there that do these different events so you find a way that you can do team building with or without a budget。

You also have to think about the time， though you're taking away from project work to invest in team building。

 So that's a consideration。 Typically， this happens with larger projects where you have brand new teams。

 smaller projects you may have just do some quick activities in your status meetings or team meetings。

 So， but it's a way， though， to get people to work together。

Some good ideas for team building for your exam include training the project team。

 so imagine you're doing a type of work or working with a new material。

 you break up into smaller groups and you try the activities out and you mix things up。

 but it's a training， but you also get to learn about one another through the training。

You do team involvement during planning like that brainstorming and the mind mapping and affinity diagrams。

 so you get people involved and you encourage people to work with one another and talk with one another and bring people into that conversation。

You will also want to establish the rules that when you have a disagreement。

 how do you do conflict management， how do you work out that problem？Offite activities。

 even for planning like a workshop is a good idea because it gets people out of the office out of that normal environment where you might feel comfortable or maybe you don't feel comfortable and it gives you a chance to do some team building and planning without other distractions。

There are opportunities for quick team involvement activities like I mentioned。

 there's all sorts of little games or icebreakers you can find online to get people talking with one another and to have little puzzles or challenges that might only take five or 10 minutes so that's a good idea to do especially early in your project if you don't have a budget or a whole lot of time The goal though is to improve your interpersonal skills and to start creating relationships so people can work together and count on each other so think about team building you'll have some questions on that for your exam。
