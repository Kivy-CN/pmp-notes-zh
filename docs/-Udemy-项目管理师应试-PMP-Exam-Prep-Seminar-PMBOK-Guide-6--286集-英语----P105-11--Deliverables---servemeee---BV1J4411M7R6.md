Throughout your project you'll be creating things， the things that your projects create called deliverables so projects create deliverables it's basically anything that's unique。

 it's verifiable it gives us a product or result or a capability it's an output of the work you do so your team creates blueprints。

 that's a deliverable your project creates a physical device that's a deliverable。

 so it's typically anything out of the project。In addition。

 it's any component of the project management plan so in planning we create a quality management plan that is a deliverable。

 doesn't mean the customer gets it， we keep it Another type of deliverable could be a piece of equipment you purchase for the project the customer doesn't get it。

 but we keep it so a deliverable is anything that the project creates or as a result of the project work。

When we have deliverables， we also have change control as soon as we have the first version。

Any changes beyond that is change control。 So as soon as we have the blueprints created。

 if if there's a change to the blueprint， that's a deliverable。 So we need change control。

The control of multiple versions of a deliverable is configuration management。

 So on these blueprints when we have to make changes。

 we want to change the size of a room or where the HVAC is or the mechanicals are。 those are changes。

 So configuration management would say this is version1， there's is version 1。1 or version 2。

 whatever the case may be version 1。3，1。4， Every time there's a change to those blueprints because we want consistency。

 we know what we have a document or blueprints it's going to be distributed。

 All these different people。Is to always make sure you have the most recent version。

 that's configuration management， that if you're changing the features and functions of even a document。

 it should go through configuration management。Once we go through scope validation。

Any change to the deliverable is going to require a formal change request， so let's talk about this。

When the project team creates the， let's say the the house。 all right， so we're building a house。

 So they create the house and we've got it all framed out and the customer comes out and they're walking into the garage and the kitchen。

 remember， it's just the studs。 It's just a frame here and they go in the kitchen。 They see。

 you know what。I've got this antique table。 this isn't big enough。 It needs to be another two feet。

 This room has to be2 feet larger。 We've already got it framed out。

So when we're doing scope validation。If there's a change， then it requires a change request。

 so you can even take it one step farther。 The customer comes in and says。

 looks at the frame and they sign off and they say it's great。 It's perfect。 exactly what I wanted。

And so then we begin putting up the sheet rock or the drywall， whatever you call it， the walls。

 actual walls of the kitchen， and then they come back in and they're like， oh。

 now I can really see it， I need more space in my kitchen here。They've already validated the scope。

 they've already approved that deliverable the framing。

 so now we have an even bigger change because there's going to be a lot more time and expense to make that change。

So once approved as part of scope validation， now you need a formal change request。And then。

 of course， in that instance， like the last bullet point changes to the deliverables mean。

 more time and cost。 So even if they made the change when we had the frames up。

 it would be time and cost because we've already paid for that labor to frame it。

 So if you change it now， you got to pay for the labor to fix it。 you already pay for the labor to。

Do it the original way。 I'm not saying it was wrong， but you have to move it over2 feet。

 So now we have more time and more money that's going to be invested in the project。

So that's some things to know with deliverables and change control All right， keep moving forward。
