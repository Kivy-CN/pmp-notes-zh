🎼。Wow， you're doing a great job， you have reached almost the end of this course。

 just a few little things to knockout， but for all effective purposes you're done。

 you have covered all the exam material。And I think that's great。

 You've done something that a lot of people don't do。

 A little secret is a lot of people sign up for these types of classes and then they fade off and they go back to their life and like oh someday I'm gonna to do that well somedays not a day in the calendar as you know。

 you have put in the work。 you've invested the time。

 you've been dedicated and you have set a goal and you're working towards achieving it and this is a big chunk of your goal to finish all of these lectures to get at this point in the course and really I think that's fantastic I know this is difficult material because I've taught it and you're talking about it for more than a week and so I know you've invested time listening to me and I appreciate that I'm grateful and I'm humbled there's so many choices out there and I'm really thankful that you've found this course and that you've chosen me to help you。

pass the P&P， but make no mistake， you're doing all the hard work。

 you're doing the heavy lifting so take confidence in that and as you go in to pass your exam just remember all of these hours that you've invested in learning this material to reach your goal of passing the P&P and I'm confident that you can do it。

So press on， keep studying， keep preparing to pass， you can do this。

Great job finishing this section on the Blitz review I told you it was a lot of information。

 really went back through and covered the entire course， the headlines of the course。

 and you had an opportunity to see every process again that we've discussed throughout the course we looked at all the way back to the beginning about initiating。

 planning， executing， monitoring， controlling and closing。

 and then we got into the very specifics from each one of the chapters in the Pimbook and from this course we looked at integration management。

 scope management， schedule management， cost， quality， resources， communications。

 risk procurement and stakeholders， then we looked at those memory cards that you're going to condense or boil down as kind of your cheat sheet when you get into the testing center。

 remember you can't write anything down until the test timer begins。

And then you did an assignment that was to map out all of the Es。 I know that was painful。

 you can get mad at me if you want， but it's going to help you learn the processes and the characteristics of the processes what you need and what you do and what you create inputs。

 tools and techniques and outputs for each one of those processes。

 So a lot of information here in this blitz review。

 this might be a section you want to watch maybe the couple of days before you go into pass your exam。

 but do complete it as you already have， obviously。

 but you might want to come back and watch it again before you pass your tests。 All right。

 great job let's keep moving forward。😊。
