嗯。One of the fun things that you can do in project management is to play some what if games so what if this activity gets done early or gets done late。

 how does that affect my schedule so with the schedule network diagram and a piece of software you can play some what if analysis so basically you ask what if X happens in the project so I hope you find some different outcomes。

 some different possibilities of outcomes。It helps you compute different outcomes and the most likely feasibility of your project schedule。

You can do this most easily in your PMIS， so a piece of software。

There are some add ons like to excel or you can buy a standalone package that has what's called a Monte Carlo analysis。

 Monte Carlo， it's named after the world famous Monte Carlo Games of Chance and gambling Hall and casinos is all of the different possibilities like on the Roulette wheel。

 So if you're using a three point estimate。Optimistic， most likely pessimistic。

 you could say if these activities come in as optimistic and these come in on time and these come in pessimistic。

 what will that do to my project so you can place some wide ifs and set some goals and some variations here。

 It's also used in risk。 so we'll see this again in Cha 11 on risk management。

It utilizes different things like your test your assumptions and constraints， obviously risk。

 what if an issue happens， and then it gives us a probability distribution。

 let me show you this is a probability distribution。

 this is a Monte Carlo add on for Excel so if you search the web you could find this little tool。

But it's just a way of seeing the sample percentages and what's the average。

 what's the max and it will build out a most likely scenario based on what you put into this worksheet so this is one that someone has created but you can also go out and buy some packages to add on to Excel that are a little bit more serious and project oriented but this is a Monte Carlo example so be aware of this for your exam you'll also see it in risk it's great for YF analysis All right good job keep moving forward。
