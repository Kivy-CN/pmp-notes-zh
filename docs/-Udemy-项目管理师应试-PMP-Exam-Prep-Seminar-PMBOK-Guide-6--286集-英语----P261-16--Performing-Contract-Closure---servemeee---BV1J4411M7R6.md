When we have a contract， we want to get to the end of that。

 we want things to go smoothly and at some point we get to close the contract so let's talk about contract closure we close according to terms。

 so payment or review or liability or support whatever it may be that's in the contract you may be subject to a performance review have to do some EVM analysis or trend analysis。

 depending on the size of the contract and obviously the type of work you're doing。

Your contracts may go through an audit process， so the audit process is where the organization that's the buyer would review。

And then completing contract closure， we want to sign off。

 sometimes called a certificate of contract closure。

 it's an agreement by both parties that we have met the terms of the contract and were done。

 and then that becomes part of the procurement file。All right， good job。
