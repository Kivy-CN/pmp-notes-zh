Of course we need to control the project scope We can't have the project team and stakeholders and vendors just making up stuff and adding stuff and removing stuff it would be just a big mess so controlling the project scope is where we want to keep everyone on track and in agreement that this is what we agreed to do and so we are doing it and this is called maintaining the scope baseline integrity that we only create what was agreed upon and what's in scope if it's out of scope that it's not something we've agreed to do so if you want to do it you' be the customer it has to go through integrated change control。

So we want to keep the project in scope within the boundaries of what we've all agreed to do。

The Es to control scope。Our inputs and our project management plan will be the scope management plan。

 the requirements management plan， change management plan， configurationration management plan。

 the scope baseline， and the performance measurement baseline。

The project documents will need to control scope， lessons learned register。

 the actual requirements documentation， the RTM。And then we'll need some work performance data。

 that raw data and OPA。Tools and techniques here， data analysis what we're looking at is variance and trend。

 so are there variances between what was planned and what was created and then are we noticing any trends from user or a project team members that they're adding things that shouldn't be in scope so they're doing some scope creep or are we noticing some issues when it comes to our scope validations so we have to do some corrective action or preventive action。

Our outputs here， you get word performance information， you get change requests。

 There's the preventive and corrective and defect repair。 So change request updates to our PM plan。

 So you might be updating the scope management plan， the scope baseline， the schedule baseline。

 cost baseline， performance measurement baseline So if I update the scope I'm going to be reflecting cost time and performance kind of hard to add to the scope without affecting those other areas that very rarely can you add to the scope without needing more money and more time。

It's possible though， that I could take things out of scope to meet the amount of time and money I have left。

 so it could work the other way too。You might have to update your project documents so your lessons learned。

 the requirements， documentation and your RTM。Let's talk about some things in control scope。

 some questions we want to ask。Are the changes agreed upon？Do we need this change in scope。

 If the answer is no， then we have some conflict resolution， we have some analysis here。

 We need to understand why they aren't agreed upon。Has the change already happened。

 so we've already had some scope creep， do we need to undo those changes or do we just live with it。

 but we say no more of that？How do we manage that existing change is what I said。

How will you incorporate and approve change so back to our kitchen scenario。

 I want this wall to go over two feet， so how do I get that into the project。

 How do I get that into my plan。And then what baseline are affected by the change， so time， cost。

Our scope， obviously， and a performance measurement baseline。

 so are those affected because we've introduced a change here？Varance analysis。 So in scope。

 we're talking about a variance in what was delivered versus what was requested。

 So we're looking at deliverables。 So the performance measurements。

 may we had specs on throughput for a network。 So this is what we wanted for throughput。

 And this is where we are。 Obviously， there's a variance in that performance。

What about the magnitude of variation， So it's real close。 Is it within that range of plus or -3%。

 for example。If it is too big， let's do some cause and effect here。

 this is the throughput that we believe we could get。 Why are we only getting this much throughput。

 Why aren't we meeting what we thought we could get so let's do some cause and effect analysis here and figure out what's happening and then can we do some corrective or preventive actions because of the variance。

Trend analysis， though， is where we're seeing things trending over time。 We're seeing a repetition。

 and we can almost predict what's going to happen based on past experiences。 earned value management。

 something we'll look at in Chapter 7 in the Pembach on cost is a suite of formulas to predict performance And to show current performance。

 So that's trend analysis， Are we improving or deteriorating when it comes to how our project is performing。

 So are we having all these random results， or are we having a steady decline or are we。Hopefully。

 getting better a little bit at a time。 What's the degree of variance。 So again。

 you could say plus or -3 per cent in regard to the throughput or to the accuracy or whatever the technical requirement is。

 And then you might have corrective or preventive actions as a result of trend analysis。All right。

 good job。 I'll see you in the next lecture。
