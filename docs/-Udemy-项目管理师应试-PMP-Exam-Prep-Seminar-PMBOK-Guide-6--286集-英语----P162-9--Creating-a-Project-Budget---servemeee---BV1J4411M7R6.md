🎼嗯。Our next cost management process is to determine the budget。Once we have estimated costs。

 then we can go into the process of determining a budget the actual allocation of funds for our project。

So to determine the budget is really about aggregation of the estimated cost。

 the individual cost of those work packages are aggregated to predict the total budget for the project。

Now sometimes your cost may be already preapped， you already have a budget that's given to you。

 so you have to do some sizing， you have X amount of dollars has to fit the amount of scope and time that fits the amount of money that you have。

 so the budget is creating this authorized cost baseline or being based on the authorized cost baseline。

The budget excludes management reserves， but it does include contingency reserves。

 so the budget includes your contingency for risk。Let's look at our Edos here for determined budget Our inputs will be the project management plan。

 in particular， the cost management plan that we just recently created， the resource management plan。

 the scope baseline。Some project documents， the basis of our estimates， cost estimates。

 project schedule， and the risk register。The business documents we need to concern ourselves with here for determining the budget。

 the business case and the benefits management plan， agreements like our contractual agreements。

 EEF and OPA。Tools and techniques， expert judgment。Cost aggregation， that's our estimates。

 our cost aggregation， the estimates then are aggregated。Data analysis， reserve analysis。

 His information review。Funding limit reconciliation and the actual financing。

Outputs of determined budget we get the cost baseline， project funding requirements。

 project document updates， cost estimates， project schedule， and the risk register。

Developing the project budget some things that we need to know for your exam。

 as far as your exam goes， cost estimating happens first that you estimate how much it will cost。

The cost budget is created based on a reliable estimate。

The actual commitment of funds to the project work is what we're talking about here with budget。

 this amount of money specifically is set aside to do these activities to create this project scope。

 to deliver the product scope。Now you may have a preassigned budget or about pre-assigned budget。

 remember is a constraint， but it could also be a risk if the budget is not realistic。

 if your scope is this big and your project budget is this big， you've got a problem。

 it's not going to fit， so that's a risk。Historical relationships， just like we saw with time。

 we can use historical information to predict cost so parametric。

And analogous are both examples of historic based estimates， Parametric。

 because we have a parameter that we're basic on。 But where did that parameter come from。

 But we have proven data of how much it costs per unit or someone has told us X amount of dollars per unit。

 if you want to buy from us。 The historical information is。

Really kind of a dangerous remember that this one's quick and it's fast， it's subjective。

 well if that accuracy of the historical information if it's not accurate。

 then that's going to create a flawed estimate to your current project。

Do you really have quantifiable parameters so you have to have repeatable processes。

 repeatable units， if there's fluctuations in these units。

 you really can't do a parametric estimating parametric has to be uniform。

 the parameter has to be the same these little fluctuations that makes it too complicated and not very reliable to create a parametric estimate。

Models have to be scalable， so a parametric model is like a cost per square foot。

 or for this type of package， the more you purchase， this is the price， so it doesn't fluctuate。

 it's a known model and it is it remains the same price whether you have $10 licenses。

 $99 each or $10000 licenses， $99 each。The concept of funding limit reconciliation means we have to reconcile what we planned it was going to cost and what we actually spent。

So this is funding limit reconciliation to two have to match， if they don't match。

 we have a cost variance。If we have a cost variance， we probably need a corrective action。

 we have to go back and re or we have to trim scope or we're going to have to ask for more money。

 so why was there a cost variance？Within the project budget。

 there's a couple of concerns that we have as we map out the budget。

What we're trying to find out will be what is the actual cost of the project？

You never know how much a project actually costs until the project is done。So in this example。

 what we're seeing here on the X axis is the project schedule。

 that's our timeline on the Y axis will be our cost。As those two arrows。

 one goes up and one goes future， as we move farther and farther than the future。

 that little curve that you see should represent the cumulative cost that we spend more and more and more and we run out of time。

 ideally we'd run out of time and money at the same point and that equals the completion of the project。

In this example， you can see that little dashed square represents our cost to date。

 and it also represents how far we've gone in the schedule。

The cost baseline is what we thought it was going to cost to get these things。

 these deliverables at this point in the schedule。Well at this point in our project。

 we are already trending away from that cost baseline。

 we have spent more than what we planned and we have done it sooner than what was anticipated。

 so this is a cost variance。So early on， I'm trying to predict will there be a trending of cost is this going to continue to have a variance。

 will my cost variance trend away and away and away from the cost baseline in this example it doesn't look very healthy right。

 we have to do a lot of work， a lot of corrective action to try to get this back in alignment with our cost baseline。

So we're looking at the actual cost of the project。All right， good job。

 I'll see you in the next lecture。
