嗯。Now let's get to work actually creating the activity list。First off， templates。

 part of our organizational process assets， if you are doing the same types of projects over and over and over。

 there's no reason to start from scratch every time creating your activity list let's take a previous project some historical information part of OPA and just adapt it to the current project so that's a real quick way of building your template or building your activity list based on a template。



![](img/4c86ab40a10135f649f3747b9902fcef_2.png)

Now template could also be that you always have certain activities that you do in your type of work。

 so it could be a prepopulated form or a plan and then you just adapt it to your project。

 so historical information or prepopulated， both of these are part of organizational process assets。

The activity list is a separate document， it's not wrapped into the WBS。

 it's a separate document that lists all of the project activities。

Typically we have an activity identifier， much like we do in the work breakdown structure。

 so it's a numbering sequence for each one of our activities。And then along with this。

 we have a scope of work description， so it might say install a big screen TV。

Well what big screen TV， which one and what room， what are the components I need。

 so it might have just a quick narrative about the make model where it's located in the house。

 any other characteristics about that work when it comes to installing that big screen TV。

Each activity has a name and a description， so we just talked about the activity ID。

 it also can link back to that work breakdown structure identifier。

 the work package that the activity is building that it's creating。

Are there any relationships between activities like you can't install that TV until the wire's been run through the house。

 you can't install the TV until the cable company actually turns on the cable and can do the testing or whatever the case may be。

 so are there any relationships that affect when the activity can take place？

We also need to look at leads and lags， so some new terms here for you and we'll see this again in this lecture or in this section。

 but let's go ahead and define these now a lead means hurry up that I'm bringing it closer to my start date so lead is considered negative time it's typically when we allow activities to overlap。

So I have to prime the walls and then I can paint the walls but we have so many walls to prime。

 I don't have to have them all done in this building before painting can start so I prime the walls and then I do some lead time negative two days from its scheduled start date so it kind of tucks under the task and now I've got people still priming while painting has started so it's an opportunity to compress the schedule lag time is just the opposite lag time think about lagging behind your you' adding time it's positive time so you prime the wall。

But it's really humid and ordinarily it only takes one day for the primer to cure。

 but it's so humid it's taking a long time to dry to set up， so we have to add a day。

 so we have a lag on the painting activity of plus one day so it pushes it out instead of tucking it under it's pushing it out。

 we have to wait。To begin painting， so lag time is waiting time。So procurement。

 we always talk about lead time and people get， well， lead time we're talking。

 I need it way out there， isn't that lag？No， it's still lead。

So I need those cabinets 30 days from tomorrow。And the procurement takes 30 days。

 So I have to start the procurement process right now。

 what I'm leading the lead time is the delivery of the cabinets， not the procurement process。

 So I need the cabinets。30 days from now。 Well， in essence， it takes 30 days to get those。

 So my lead time is as if I want them right now， because it takes 30 days to get here。

 So it's lead time。 Your negative time right here because it's going to take 30 days for that activity for the cabinets to be delivered。

 lead time is always negative time。 You're bringing it closer to your start date。

Lag time is always positive， you're pushing it away， you're adding to the schedule duration。

Some other activity attributes， we have resource requirements， what resources do you need。

 people and materials are there any imposed dates like you have to get this work done by a deadline because the inspectors coming or there's a trade show or we're contractually obligated to hit that date are there any constraints and assumptions that always are you have to use a particular resource you have a team member that's going on vacation in the middle of your project you only have so much time you can only be at the work site between8 in the morning and six at night so what constraints do you have。

What assumptions do you have， you assume everyone's going to be on the project。

 you assume the vendor will deliver on time， but those are things that could all affect your schedule。

 the actual duration。And any other information you have to add to your activity attributes。

Effort and project activities。 so I mentioned this a little bit earlier LOE level of effort。

 These are support activities， the project manager activities， so things like reporting， budgeting。

 inspecting， meeting， creating memos or emails or just a management。 that's level of effort。

 They really don't contribute to the project scope， but they're needed to manage the work。

Discrete activities are the activities that we describe actually creates the project scope。

 so discrete effort activities are things like installing the fixtures， installing those cabinets。

 and doing the electrical work， those are discrete because they are focused on creating the deliverable。

A proportioned effort are the project management work so things like quality insurance integrated change control and communications so level of effort and app proportionported effort aored effort it's hard to say those are activities that support the project so those two are typically well sometimes they're called nonvalue because they sometimes because they aren't contributing to the business value I would take。

A small stand against that and say they are a value add because you have to do those in order to contain and manage and keep the project moving forward。

 but they are support activities， they aren't really contributing to the project scope。

 but we need to do them， so they're seen as overhead。Al right。

 so be familiar with those terms for your exam， especially the idea of an activity list and how it relates to the work breakdown structure and work packages All right。

 good job keep moving forward。
