。Once we are in a project and we've identified stakeholders。

 we really begin to manage stakeholder engagement， we're going to be interacting with those stakeholders once we create that stakeholder engagement plan then we follow that plan to interact and engage stakeholders so managing stakeholder engagement we do throughout the project。

We want to obtain， confirm， maintain and promote commitment to the project。

 so we're talking about current maintenance， but also changing those people that are negative or unaware about our project。

 we want them engaged and we want them committed to the project so we manage stakeholder expectations that's important as well have a clear understanding of what we're creating。

We have to do some negotiation and communication so you think about requirements gathering。

 that's overlaps here with stakeholder engagement， so negotiate and obviously communicate。

As there are concerns about our project or risk or introduced to our project or the outputs of a risk response happen。

 we want to anticipate that and communicate and engage stakeholders and then any issues。

 especially when people are gossiping or talking outside the project。

 then we have to work to clarify those issues and so often those are due to rumors or miscommunication so we want to clarify and resolve issues or if there's some misunderstandings between the project and our stakeholders that we go to the problem we can't ignore it。

Let's look at the Es for managing stakeholder engagement。Some inputs here。

 you want to reference your PM plan， so the communications management plan， the risk management plan。

 stakeholder engagement plan， and your change management plan。Project documents， your change log。

 your issue log， lessons learned and stakeholder register， and of course， E EF and OPA。

Tools and techniques， expert judgment。Communication skills。

 so we're looking for feedback and offering feedback。

We will rely on some interpersonal and team skills， so conflict management， cultural awareness。

 again negotiation， observation and conversation， and having some political awareness。

 we know politics are going to happen。Ground rules are needed and meetings。

Our outputs here may have changed requests。Updates to your PM plan。

 your communications management plan and stakeholder engagement plan and updates to project documents。

 your change log， your issue log， lessons learned， and your stakeholder register。

Because you may identify new stakeholders during this process and engagement strategies may change or interest may change or more information becomes available so you update that stakeholder register。

So how do you engage a stakeholder the number one way is communication people need information。

 but they need precise information at the right time and the right modality so a blast out email may not always be the best way to communicate you have to think about well what does a stakeholder need what are they interested in what's their concern so you try to see。

the concern or the project from their perspective， from their point of view。

 and that helps you to better manage that engagement， if you understand what they're concerned about。

 then you can better engage that stakeholder。You'll need some interpersonal skills here。

 conflict management， sometimes stakeholders get emotional about your project or they get upset the project's happening。

 so we need some emotional intelligence and some conflict management。Some cultural awareness。

 think about a very large project and how it may span the globe and you're dealing with different cultures and that can introduce some issues in the project。

You may have to negotiate with stakeholders， so that means give and take and reaching a fair outcome as part of negotiation。

Sometimes you just need to observe stakeholders and how they do work or how your solution will affect them。

 let them show you how your project's going to affect them and talk to people。

 it's not a combative relationship we want to understand and be helpful to our stakeholders。

 really important concept for your exam。And then in light of all of that though。

 we have to think about political awareness， that politics are going to happen and having some effective listening here。

 really understanding what people are saying and what the underlying intent may be。

 that's political awareness， understanding some politics。

Some other methods to engage stakeholders remember our team charter。

 so our team charter house those ground rules what in our ground rules we're talking about how do we。

Act as a team， how do we operate as a team so when it comes to our project team everyone's responsible for enforcing ground rules。

 which includes change control。So stakeholders may come to the team and try to do some scope creep that should be one of our ground rules here so the team charter comes into play that we respect the change control system and how things can come into change management。

Meetings is a common tool and techniques， so when it comes to engaging stakeholders。

 we're talking about doing some decision making and some issue resolution sometimes you just have to make the decision that some people aren't going to be happy with so you have to make a decision that's best for the project lessons learned and retrospective if you're in an adaptive environment。

Kickoff meetings， we move from planning into execution， we do a kickoff meeting。

If you're an adaptive， you do sprint planning or that iteration planning。

 and then status updates so you're communicating and that's a way of engaging stakeholders so keep people involved with your status reports。

All right， great job， those are some ways to engage stakeholders。
