🎼Sometimes in quality， especially quality planning。

 we don't know what the best outcome would be from a decision until we make the decision。

 So design of experiments is a way to test variables to find the most appropriate outcome for our project。

 So I love to give this little scenario here。We have these three different postcards。

And the postcards are an invitation to come visit Florida。 I live down in Florida。

 So I want you to come visit Florida。 And so these postcards are a marketing campaign。

 And we're going to mail out  a million postcards。 But those are our three choices。

 So rather than just picking one and dropping a million postcards in the mail。

 What we'll do first is we'll mail out 100000 of each one of those。

 So A B and C will do 100000 each of the 1 million addresses we have whichever one of those campaigns gets the best results。

 We get the best response from that will be the postcard that will mail out the remaining 700000。

So the best results win you might do this if you're painting。

 you ever painted your house and you put up three or four swatches of paint and just kind of live with it for a day or two or a week or two。

 And you just want to kind of get the feel and see how the sun head sits it。

 And what's it look like when， you know， the fresh paint begins to fade a little bit。

 So that's design of experiments。 It's a way of comparing results to determine what decision you'll make for the remainder of the population。

 the remainder of the activity， whether it's painting the whole house that color or mailing out these postcards。

Okay， that's design of Exp。
