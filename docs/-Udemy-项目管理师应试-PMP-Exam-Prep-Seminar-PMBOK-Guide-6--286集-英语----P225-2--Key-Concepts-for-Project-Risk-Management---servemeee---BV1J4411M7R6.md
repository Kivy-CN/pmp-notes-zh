Risk is not always a bad thing。Risk is an uncertain event that could have a positive or a negative effect on your project。

So risk in and of itself is just the uncertainty， it's often the effect that we think of as being bad or negative。

In projects， we have two big categories of risk， we have business risk， and we have pure risk。

 Pu risk is the danger， the loss of life for limb。Business risk is the investment that you could lose or the potential to earn a return on that investment。

A pure risk has no。Positive opportunity a pure risk is always negative because someone could get injured or hurt or loss of life or limb that is pure risk business risk is where most of us think of and what comes to risk think about your investments in the stock market or your savings or a new business that you start up。

A pure risk， you think about the dangerous work in construction or healthcare or manufacturing or other disciplines where an individual could get hurt in your project。

 that is a pure risk。When we think about planning for risk management。

 as were going to do in just a moment， to create the risk management plan。

A are some terms that we need to know as we go into planning first off is the risk appetite it's how hungry is an organization or a group of stakeholders for risk so you think about they see it opportunity so we want to really seize that opportunity don't think of risk as negative it's the opportunity because they have a risk appetite so they want to take on risk。

Risk tolerance is what's that unease， what's their level of tolerance for the amount of risk in the project。

The risk threshold describes at what point would I cross the significance of a risk？

 And now I'm uncomfortable with that。 So what's my risk threshold that once I get beyond this point now I'm uncomfortable。

 Ri threshold could also mean that a risk event is known and at some point we're going to cross the threshold and that risk event is going to happen。

 So a threshold is also like you're crossing the threshold of a doorway So if the conditions continue to go。

 we're going to hit this risk threshold threshold and now the event is likely to happen。

Stakeholder tolerance for risk means how willing will a stakeholder be to accept risk or to allow risk or they want to avoid risk。

 so the stakeholder tolerance really describes their appetite。

 the generic term of risk tolerance and the risk threshold。Sometimes probably not for your exam。

 but sometimes you'll see this idea of the utility function。

 which describes the tolerance and the amount of risk that an organization will take on and how they will allow risk or promote risk。

 positive risk in the organization。The other theme that we need to know is the relationship between the project priority and the cost of risk elimination。

 and so you have these two S curves here， an inverted S that's the dash line and the solid line that's going up。

So on the solid line that's going up means the higher the project priority inverse to the dash line coming down。

 the higher the project priority， the more an organization is willing to spend on risk management。

 the more they'll spend to eliminate risk， so a very high profile project。

 you would want to spend to eliminate risk that could threaten the success of this high profile project。

 but a low project priority way over there at the end the dashed line coming down。

Those projects like you're going to replace all the keyboards or you have just you're going to decommission a piece of equipment。

 It's a low priority。 Does it have a lot of significance in the organization。

 So we're not going to spend as much generally to eliminate risk in those scenarios。

 So it's just pretty common sense that more important a project is the more willing an organization will be to spend money to eliminate risk。

All right， so those are some themes we'll see throughout this section。
