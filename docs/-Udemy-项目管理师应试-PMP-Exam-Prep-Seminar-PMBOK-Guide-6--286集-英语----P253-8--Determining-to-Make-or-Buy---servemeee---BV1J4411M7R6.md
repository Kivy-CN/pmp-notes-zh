In a project there's lots of reasons why you're going to buy something or build something Sometimes it's more effective to hire a vendor than to take it on in house Other times you have more important things to do than some of these low-level activities so you farm it out so let's look at reasons to buy or build and then I'm going show you a little formula that you'll need to know when it comes to determining price should you buy or build。

First off， why would I buy a bill that's less costly， could be cheaper to hire a vendor。

 might be cheaper to do it in house。 You have people that are available。 So you use in house skills。

 you control the work by doing the work in house。 also by creating it in house。

 you control the intellectual property。Opportunity to learn a new skill available staff that could be for you or the vendor。

 the vendor said hey， we have people ready to work and we'll give you a reduced rate so they're just looking to cover their cost and also elects your team by giving stuff to a vendor than your team can focus on more important activities or focus on the core project work。

So those are all reasons why you might buy and why you might build。

Sometimes you have to make a determination， should I buy something or should I build it？

So here's the scenario。You know your team can build it for $65，000。Once it's built， it will cost $8。

500 to support every month。A vendor comes to you and they say， you know what。

 we can build that for $52，000。 You just have to sign a contract with us to let us support it for $10。

500 a month。So you're like， well， upfront that's a pretty good deal， it's less out of pocket。

 but every month I'm paying a little bit more。So to make the determination of which is the best decision。

 you find the difference of your out of pocket expense， so 65000 minus 52，000。

 That's the difference between the build versus buy， so that's 13000。

Then you find the difference of your monthly fee in。It would be $10，500 minus-$8500 or $2000。

 so the difference there you divide by the difference of your out of pocket。 so 13。

000 divided by 2000 is 6。5。 What that tells you is that 6 and a half months from now。

 you could have built it in house and only paid 8500 a month as opposed to 10，500。

So if your solution will be kept longer than six and a half months。

 it's better to go ahead and build it yourself。If it will be kept less than6 and a half months。

 let the vendor do it。 It's a better deal for you。 So that's a buy versus build。

Let's do an example here together if you want to， you can pause this and try it on your own and then come back or we can walk through it together right now。

 so if you want to pause it，You can， if not。Here we go。Your team can create a solution for $245，600。

And it will cost you 23，500 per month to support it。A vendor says their solution is only $12，000。

But you have to sign a contract and pay them $49，000 a month。Okay。

 so which would be a better solution， yours or the vendors？So if we drop in the facts here。

To build it is 245，000。To buy is only 12000。 that's a difference of $233600。Your monthly fee is 235。

The vendor's fee is 49。 so what's the difference of $25500 every month。

You divide the monthly into your out of pocket expense， and you'll see that in 9。1 months。

It would be better to build it than to buy it。 so if you're going to keep this longer the 9。1 months。

 go ahead and build it。Less than 9。1 months， it's a better deal with the vendor。

So you might have to do that on your exam so beware of that on your exam know how to do that make up some practice ones a question I get a lot is well what if the monthly fee is also less than your monthly fee that's a great deal it'll never catch up so be aware of that for your exam generally the monthly fee is going be more than your monthly fee All right。

 keep moving forward I'll see you in the next lecture。
