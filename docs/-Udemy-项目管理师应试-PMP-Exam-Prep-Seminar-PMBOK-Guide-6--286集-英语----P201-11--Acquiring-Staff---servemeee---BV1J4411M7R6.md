So you're the project manager and you've got to get people on your team。

 you have to acquire people to get on your team， so you're doing this process of acquiring staff。

Well for many project managers， this is an easy process because the team is preassigned the project charter or early in project planning。

 you may be assigned a group of people as your team。

 or maybe you work with the same people over and over and over， that's just your team for projects。

We also have to consider the availability though， so what other projects are they on or what operational assignments do they have and that can affect when people can come work on your project。

Is this part of a competitive contract so you are doing projects for others and so your team is built and they go in and do the work and they have to get the work done because now they have other contracts to go on to。

Is it required as part of the project charter， or is this an internal project when your team is assigned to you？

This might be an opportunity to complete on the job training for a team member。

 so you get one individual or two or three people that are assigned to your team to learn。

 so they have some on the job training。If you don't have people internally。

 you might turn to a vendor to do some contracting to get contracted labor。

 so when you deal with a procurement for staffing， your costs are likely to increase。

 so what is the most cost effective way to get those people onto your team？

Resource leveling can affect your cost and procurement as well。

 the procurement may have a constraint that you could only use that individual 40 hours a week max because above 40 the rate goes up so they could have resource leveling for those individuals that are contractors。

When we talk about procurement for staffing， we also want to look at well are there internal resources。

 if there are internal resources， let's use those people first assuming they're available。

If those people can't complete the work because they have other project assignments or operational duties。

 one or two things is going to happen， your project is going to get delayed because you're waiting for those resources or you have to turn to procurement to hire people or to use contracted labor。

 so these are all considerations when it comes to procurement for staffing。
