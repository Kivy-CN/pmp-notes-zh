🎼。Throughout your project you'll be working to hit your target milestones。

 but what are milestones Mis are just a marker that show progress。

 The idea of a milestone is from the Roman era and creating these oblik that or an obelisk that would be separated about every one mile and then they're giving a a unique number。

 see mile marker1 Mi marker 45 or whatever and it shows how far you've come and how far you have to go between cities so in a project we use that same term to describe how far you've come and how far they're still to go or we have markers here for significant delivery we have a milestone for the foundation being signed off We have a milestone for the framing being signed off So those are significant events typically we get a milestone at the。

En of a project phase or key deliverables in a project， those are milestones。In project management。

 a milestone typically has no duration。 it's just a marker。 There's no duration on a milestone。

 so don't let that fool you。Miilestones also have no resources assigned to them。

 they're just a marker in the project so you can look at your schedule and see these milestones。

A milestone chart is a way to visualize when milestones are scheduled and when you actually hit the milestone so the little white up triangle that's planned the solid down triangle that's what was actual and then the line between the two shows how much of a variances did you have so you want those triangles to be close together so in this example you can see the permits took a little bit longer than what was planned and where it actually was。

And if we look down at electrical， you can see it's kind of pushed everything out electrical then was we were planned to hit it in February。

 we actually hit it looks like right at the top of March。

 so it's the line between shows the variance so that's a milestone chart and you can see all the different milestones are typically the end of a phase like we have here。

Great job。 That's our milestone information。 Know that for your exam。

 I'll see you in the next lecture。
