If I'm building a house for you， would you just trust me when I said we're done and here's the keys。

 or would you want to walk around a little bit and inspect things before you know you write me that big check？

Probably you're going to want to inspect it because I don't know much about construction。

 so you'll want to inspect it and make certain that what I've created is what you've asked for。

 In fact， you probably wouldn't wait till the very end of the project。

 you would have these intermittent opportunities to inspect what I've created。

 and that is validate scope。 validateate scope is an inspection driven process where the customer inspects the project deliverables。

This is typically done at the end of each phase， but also at project completion。

You might know this as a review or an audit or a walkthrough of what's been created。

The goal here is to get the customer to accept the work， so validate scope is all about acceptance。

Let's check out the EOs for validateate scope， our inputs， we have the project management plan。

 specifically the scope management plan。The requirements management plan and the scope baseline。

Then we have some project documents， your lessons learned to register， quality reports。

 requirements documentation， and the requirements traceability matrix。

 and then you'll have verified deliverables and the work performance data。

Tools and techniques to validate scope， inspection。

 the customer or the recipient of what you're creating， they have to inspect the work。

 this could also be like a city inspector is acting on the customer's behalf and then decision making and you might have some voting as one way to make decisions you might have multiple stakeholders that they vote on acceptability。

Your outputs will be the accepted deliverables work performance information change request。

 and then you have some project document updates like your lessons learned register。

 the requirements doc and the requirements traceability matrix when it comes to inspecting the project work and we're using the description like your measuring you're exam or testing。

 you're validating you're doing reviews， you're doing a walk through。

 it's any of these terms where the customer is inspecting the deliverable So on your exam when you see these types of terms like I'm inspecting。

 I'm touching， I'm walking through， I'm testing and I'm the customer and you're the project manager I'm inspecting the work so I'm doing scope validation So just know it can kind of be some cues here as to this process scope validation is all about formally accepting the project work that I want the customer to sign off。

On what we've done， I want them to agree this is good and we've met the requirements and they're happy。

So it's acceptance and are signing off。 You could have change request。

 So the customer may notice a mistake， so you have to do a corrective or defect repair。

 So that could cause a change request。 It could also be the customer says， hey。He did a great job。

 but I want to add a few things， so sure we can do that。 let's do a change request。

 we need more time and money to make it happen， and then we'll go do it。

Scope validation and quality control are very similar。 All。

 So you're going to be ahead of the curve here。 Quality control。

 Chapter 8 on quality is an inspection driven activity。 However。

 the goal of quality control is I inspect the work before the customer does。 So me。

 the project manager or my project team。 we inspect the work and our goal is to keep mistakes out of the customer's hands。

Scope validation is the customer inspects the works。

 and the goal is for the customer to sign off and to say it's good and they accept it。 So Q C is。

 I want to keep mistakes out of the customer's hands。 Spe validation。

 I want the customer to accept what we've been created。 Q， C always precedes scope validation。

 You do it first。 All right， good job。 Keep moving forward。
