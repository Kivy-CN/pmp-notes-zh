🎼。Let's talk about statistical sampling， so much fun。

 so a statistical sample is where we go out and we get a percentage of the results。

 we just pick them out at random and then based on those results gives us some insight as to how the rest of the population will look or what we can expect of the remainder of the project。

 it also allows us to begin setting some goals for improvement。

So it's a percentage of results at random。 so for example。

 we went out and we picked 20% of all units randomly and we checked quality on that 20%。

So that 20% would be an indicator for the remainder of the project。

 the other 80% of that batch of whatever we're creating。

So it has to be completed though on a consistent basis on a regular schedule or throughout your manufacturing or throughout your project。

 you just can't randomly do this。 you have a set every time there's an opportunity to do that。

Bache of 1000 and you're going to go out grab 20%， you do it。

Statistical sampling can help us make changes in improvement so that can reduce the cost of quality control if we had to inspect every single item that could be very expensive。

 So statistical sampling， especially in repeatable processes。

 is a way to bring that cost of quality control down。However， if you don't have a good testing plan。

 if you don't have a regular schedule， it can be hard to do。If you want to do statistical sampling。

 there is a catch。 What you're inspecting has to be the same thing。

 so I can't go out and inspect the installation of doors。

 And that would tell me if the windows are installed incorrectly。

 So it's like these water bottles here， they're all the same。 they're all to be uniform。

 So when I go to a sampling， it has to reflect the rest of that population。

 So statistical sampling on a regular basis。 you need a testing plan or a sampling plan and you do it throughout the project on the same types of deliverables。

All right， good job， that's statistical sampling。
