This is key concepts for project resource management。As we begin to discuss resource management。

 there are some factors that we need to consider in regard to our project resources。

 regard to the people and the equipment or materials that we need first off determine what resources are needed so we can do this when we create our activity list as one of those processes we can do in tandem but once we identify the resources then we have to get those resources for a project so you think about procurement or contracting or working with other project managers or functional managers to get the people that you need on your project。

Once we have the resources we control the resources in particular we're talking about the physical resources that if you have materials and equipment and tools at your job site。

 want to make certain there's not waste or things go missing or someone comes and steals the materials that you want to control those resources and protect them and that they're only available when they're needed。

 you control access and you control the resources。We also have to consider the human side of this equation human and physical resources first off we have two calendars we need to address the project calendar and the resource calendar the project calendar is when the work can take place Monday through Friday 8 a。

 to 6 p。m。 that's our project calendar。The resource calendar though。

 will be when resources are available， so we take into consideration things like vacation。

 responsibilities among the organization that people may already be scheduled on or other projects。

 so when are the human resources available？Physical resources also may have a calendar。

 you think about reserving a room every Monday for your status meeting。

 so you need a physical resource， you want to go schedule that or a piece of equipment you have to schedule so the resource calendar is needed here。

The project team and the project manager need to have a spirit of collaboration that we're in this together that we're all part of the same team working towards the same objectives。

 so we want to have this willingness to work we want our team members to be willing to do the work and be dedicated to do the work so we're talking about buy in and synergy and a sense of ownership and we need to have people participate。

If we sense that people are wanting to leave the project。

 then we need to address our project team retention that we want the team members to stay on the project to be part of the team to be involved because we need that resource they're on the team for a reason。

 so we want to keep them there and keep them involved。

If we're dealing with unions or a contractual relationship。Then we have to address labor relations。

 so we have to follow the rules of the Union， we have to follow the rules of that contractual relationship。

 so any type of a collective bargaining agreement is labor relations。

 we have to abide by those rules in that agreement。We may be asked to do performance appraisals。

 so we have to do an assessment of how well our project team members are working。

 and this can include the vendor if we have a contractual relationship with the vendor。

Of course we want to address our work， health and safety issues。

 especially if your discipline has pure risk， a pure risk is only downside。

 someone gets injured or loss of life or limb Of course we don't want that so we think about safety we think about health in the dangerous work that may be taking place in our project so we want to be very clear that we do not want any type of injury or anyone to get disabled or really hurt on our project so we address those and we address safety and you can see how that's integrated back to quality in the cost of quality with our people with our human resources。

The project is temporary and so too is the project team。

 so we have to really create an effort and establish a team and promote team development because we want our team to not have the mindset that this is temporary so I don't need to create a relationship with my teammates people will work better together if they have a personal relationship with other people on the project team so we're talking about team development and promoting team development and we'll talk about that more in this section。

Some influences on the project team， the team environment where people are physically doing the work can affect how people interact with one another。

You might be dealing with a virtual team where people have dispersed around the globe。

 so we have geographical concerns for the team working together。

Communication among stakeholders is so important that we want people to share information with one another。

 but we also want to be able to capture that information。

 so our communications management plan which will be in section 10 of the Pibaok。

 the communications management， so we want to promote communication but we need to be able to capture that communication。

And then we have to address any type of an organizational change organizational change management addresses several concerns。

 one could be a new policy or procedure that could be an organizational change you might have a change in leadership or upper management and that can influence your project team and then the project that you're creating is about change so your project may be creating organizational change so we have to think about the perception of that change and the influence that change has on our project team so we want our members to feel secure and safe and to acknowledge that change is happening in the organization and how does it affect our project。

We'll also address internal and external politics， internal politics we see those office politics。

 those underlying and hidden agendas that people have， that they often bring into a project。

 so we need to have a clear understanding of the power the political capital that you or a stakeholder has and how that affects your project team。

External politics， we're talking about a government and the politics in your community or in your country and how those can affect your project。

 especially if you're doing a public project or you're in a discipline like healthcare that seems to always be affected by laws and regulations and so how does that affect your projects that you're trying to do in the organization？

If your team is dispersed around the globe， you're going to be dealing with different cultures and so those culture issues。

 those cultural issues may affect how people communicate and work with one another on your project team。

Also the structure of your organization so the organizational uniqueness can affect how people work with one another。

 so these are all concerns when it comes to influencing your project team。

Considers for physical resources， when we think about physical resources。

 you think about equipment and tools， facilities， so you need to schedule that equipment and facilities and the infrastructure that you need in order to communicate in order to have meetings in order to do the work if you don't schedule these tools and equipment and facilities on time。

 you don't establish that infrastructure then you have a risk of the project being delayed because you're waiting for that resource to become available so it introduces a project risk and this can really create a domino chain of risk and delays and issues in your project so it's very important to schedule materials upfront and your resources and whatever infrastructure you may need。

Low quality materials could damage the overall quality of the product。

 so we saw this back in chapter 8 in the pemba and quality management that low quality is always a problem So imagine you are in construction and you get two by fours in for your project and these are all warped or they're curvy or wavy。

 that's poor quality it's not was needed in the project so I'm not talking about great about oak versus plywood talking about receiving materials that are not of quality that they are substandard and they need to be rejected if we try to make those low quality products work to keep our schedule。

 we could actually be going backwards because we use the material and then that material could cause problems when we get into quality control and scope validation So the team needs to be able to spot low quality material and be empowered to act upon it。

Too much material， too much inventory will equal the high operation cost。 So on our job site。

 we're building a house， we can't have all the materials delivered at once。

 typically we don't because we only have so much space for all those materials。

 you have to worry about theft or the materials getting damaged and if we have a whole bunch of materials at once that can drive our cost if there are any theft or damage or upfront a lot of costs invested in the project。

 So too much inventory equals high operation cost。 we want a uniform approach to when the materials should be delivered based on the phases and the work in our project。

A lowlel inventory， the opposite is going to affect our customer demand and satisfying the customer demand if we don't have enough material to do the work。

 then we have a delay。 we have a stoppage in our project because we're waiting for resources so we really have to balance and do some supply chain management here having too much is no good and certainly too little is no good so what's just right with the amount of materials we need in our project。

All right， great job you're knocking this out that's our first lecture talking about some considerations and for physical and human resources I'll see you in the next lecture。

😊。
