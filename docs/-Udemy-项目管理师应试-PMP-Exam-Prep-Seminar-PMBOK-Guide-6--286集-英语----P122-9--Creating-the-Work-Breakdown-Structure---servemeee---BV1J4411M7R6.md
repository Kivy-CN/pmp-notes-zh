One of the most important documents that we'll need in a project is the work breakdown structure„ÄÇ

 the WBSÔºå the work breakdown structureÔºå it's a decomposition of the project scope„ÄÇ

 it really visualizes the project work so you take the project scope and you decompose it„ÄÇ

Which brings us to the worst joke in the whole course„ÄÇ

 And that's the project work breakdown structure is a lot like Mozart„ÄÇ For a long time„ÄÇ

 Mozart was composing„ÄÇBut now he is„ÄÇDecomposing„ÄÇThere you goÔºå I told you it wasn't a good joke„ÄÇ

 but now you'll never forget that WBS is decomposed from the project scopeÔºå it's broken down„ÄÇ

So you subdivide the project workÔºå the smallest item in the work package„ÄÇ

 the smallest item in the WBS is called a work package„ÄÇ

 a work package might be like the garage door or the window in the kitchen or a particular function that a piece of software does„ÄÇ

Or a particular function that a piece of software does could be a work package„ÄÇ

 Let's take a look at the Es here to create a work breakdown structure„ÄÇSo our inputs for the WBS„ÄÇ

 the project planÔºå particularly the scope management planÔºå Project documents„ÄÇ

 we have the project scope statement and the requirements documentation„ÄÇ

 and of course we have EEF and OPA„ÄÇAre two tools and techniques to create the WBS expert judgment and decomposition our outputs will be the scope baseline„ÄÇ

 remember the scope baseline we need three components„ÄÇ

 the WBS WBS dictionary and the scope statement will have project document updates„ÄÇ

 the assumptions log and requirements documentation„ÄÇTo create the WBS„ÄÇ

 we take the project scope statement and we decompose it we break it down into smaller and smaller items„ÄÇ

 So it's deliverables oriented„ÄÇ I'm building that house for you„ÄÇ So in my WBS„ÄÇ

 I would say this is the garageÔºå the living roomÔºå the kitchenÔºå the master bedroomÔºå and so on„ÄÇ

Then in the kitchen I would say we have cabinets and break those down and then we have appliances and those types of appliances we have a refrigerator and a stove and a microwave and a dishwasher„ÄÇ

 so it's the decomposition of deliverablesÔºå this is not the activity list„ÄÇ

 we're talking about things that you get if I finish the project„ÄÇ

It's a major component of the scope baseline and it will help with project planning we're going to see the WBS and the scope baseline be an input to a lot of our planning activities„ÄÇ

It really visualizes what's in the projectÔºå it clearly defines what's in scope and what's out of scope„ÄÇ

 so it serves as a deterrent to change„ÄÇWithin the work breakdown structure„ÄÇ

 there's a couple of terms that we need to know we have control accounts and code of accounts„ÄÇ

 a control account are for work packagesÔºå so this idea of a control account plan„ÄÇ

I'm building a house for you and in the kitchenÔºå we have set backÔºå let's say„ÄÇ

$75000 for the construction of your kitchen„ÄÇSo a control account plan is that $75„ÄÇ

000 for the kitchen„ÄÇI don't need to know today what type of cabinets you want and what type of countertops or appliances„ÄÇ

 but those things cannot exceed 75Ôºå000„ÄÇ Everything in the kitchen is up to 75„ÄÇ

000 and that's a control account plan or sometimes called a cap„ÄÇ

 but a control account plan is a way of segmenting All right that's the kitchen we have 75„ÄÇ

000 for itÔºå and these are the decisions to be made„ÄÇ

Those decisions to be made are called planning packagesÔºå so you'll see that again later on„ÄÇ

 so like what type of countersÔºå what type of appliances and so on„ÄÇ

 those are part of the cap and they planning packagesÔºå not work packagesÔºå they' planning packages„ÄÇ

A code of account though is much simpler„ÄÇ A code of account is just a numbering system„ÄÇ

 so the project is 107 and then it's the garage is 107„ÄÇ1„ÄÇ the kitchens 107„ÄÇ2Ôºå the living rooms 107„ÄÇ

3 and then you pin that numbering system to each deliverable so it just gives everything in the WBS a unique identifier„ÄÇ

You could do work breakdown structure template sometimes called the WBTÔºå I take a similar project„ÄÇ

 and I adapt it to this project„ÄÇI've been in some organizations where they do the same type of works over and over and over„ÄÇ

 so they take a prepopulated WBS for every projectÔºå they have these standard things they create„ÄÇ

 and then they just customize it and update it for the current project„ÄÇ

I've mentioned the W B S Dictionary a few times„ÄÇ The W B S dictionary is basically a dictionary„ÄÇ

 It describes each item that we're creating„ÄÇ It gives information like that code of account identifier that numbering sequence talks about„ÄÇ

 wellÔºå what is this thing What assumptions and constraints are tied to it„ÄÇWho's responsible for it„ÄÇ

 How does this contribute to the milestonesÔºüWhat activities are needed to create this thing„ÄÇ

What resources are neededÔºå what are the costÔºå what are the qualityÔºüWhat's the acceptance criteriaÔºü

What technical references will go with these deliverables and then if you're working with a vendor do you have contract information so basically the WBS is a way of taking each work package„ÄÇ

 each deliverable and defining it and so it's a way it's going to help us when we get into cost estimating and we get into schedule duration estimating because I need to know all this kind of stuff because that'll help me make a more accurate cost estimate and a more accurate duration estimate for the activities to create these things„ÄÇ

Just to be clearÔºå because you're going to see this term a lot„ÄÇ

 the scope baseline are three documentsÔºå The scope statementÔºå the WBS dictionary and the WBS„ÄÇ

 All rightÔºå great job„ÄÇ You're making good progress„ÄÇ Keep moving forward„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ
