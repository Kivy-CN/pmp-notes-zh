There are still some more charts you should be familiar with for your exam„ÄÇ

 So let's take a look at those Now„ÄÇ The first 1 I want to show you is a prereto diagram„ÄÇ

 Prereto was an Italian macroeconomist who was outpic peas in his garden„ÄÇ

 And he noticed that 80% of his crop came from just 20% of his peas„ÄÇ

80% of his harvest came from 20% of his pea plants„ÄÇ So he's the guy who developed that 8020 rule„ÄÇ

 If you've ever worked on help deskÔºå you know the 8020 rule„ÄÇ

80% of your calls will come from 20% of the users„ÄÇ All right„ÄÇ

 or 80% of your income will come from 20% of your businesses„ÄÇ So Peretto diagram„ÄÇ

 A prereto diagram is a bar chart„ÄÇ It's a histogram that shows categories of defects from largest to smallest„ÄÇ

 So in this exampleÔºå this is the total number of failures for a tractor or for a scanner rather„ÄÇ

And you can see the biggest number of failure we have are the skills people don't understand our software„ÄÇ

 so we've got a problem with our softwareÔºå the skills that's too difficult to use„ÄÇ

 and then we have the tractorÔºå that device that will move the light back and forth and then the actual lights burning out and we have a USB problem and so on„ÄÇ

 So it's the largest category of failures down to the smallest failure„ÄÇ

The little bar chart the little connected dots you see across the top„ÄÇ

That's the total each dot represents the upstream number of failures and the current failure„ÄÇ

So if we look at the lightÔºå the little dot above the lightÔºå that's a total of about 380 failures„ÄÇ

 And that accounts for the lightÔºå the tractor and the skills„ÄÇ

 So the closer we get to 100% on the right„ÄÇ The more defects we're including in this analysis„ÄÇ

 UsuallyÔºå we focus on the big problems firstÔºå as those are resolved or they begin to diminish„ÄÇ

 Then we rearrange this order„ÄÇ and then we attack the next big problems„ÄÇ rearrange it„ÄÇ

 and the next big problems and so on„ÄÇ So that's a peretto diagram„ÄÇ

 A Peretto diagram is really a bar chart„ÄÇ Another name for a bar chart is a histogram„ÄÇ

 This is a histogram to show how vendors management and different teams are performing or whatever your're tracking here„ÄÇ

 numberumb of change request where they're coming from or issues or what have you„ÄÇ

 But it's just a bar chart„ÄÇ So a histogram„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

Just a bar chartÔºå Nothing to get too excited about„ÄÇ

A scatter diagram shows the relationship between two variablesÔºå so these dots represent the sampling„ÄÇ

 so this first oneÔºå the taller an individual isÔºå the bigger their shoe size„ÄÇ

 so you can see those two have a pretty positive correlation that they're tracking together pretty closely„ÄÇ

Then we have soup salesÔºå the colder it is outsideÔºå the more soup we're selling„ÄÇ

 So that also has a correlation here„ÄÇ And then shoe size and annual income doesn't really look to be correlated„ÄÇ

 It doesn't just because you have big feet doesn't mean you make more„ÄÇSo there some correlation here„ÄÇ

 you have a positive correlation„ÄÇ that is one quantity increases„ÄÇ

 so does the other A negative correlation as one quantity increasesÔºå the other decreases„ÄÇ

 So the warmer it gets the less soup you sell„ÄÇ Who wants soup in the summer„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

And then no correlation like the shoe size and your income„ÄÇ

 those don't necessarily correlate with one another„ÄÇThen we have a run chart„ÄÇ

 a run chart is similar to a control chartÔºå The difference is the little dots you see„ÄÇ

 the closer those dots are together that shows the time it took to accumulate that pool that you're measuring so earlier we said each one of those was a000 so you can see those dots at the top that are very close together that means we have a short amount of time to do those 1000 instances„ÄÇ

 the farther away the two dots are then it took longer to accumulate 1000 so there may not be a correlation between the two„ÄÇ

This also shows us a trend when you have five or more„ÄÇData points all going up or all going down„ÄÇ

 it means you have a trend„ÄÇIf you have two or more at the same valueÔºå you only count one of them„ÄÇ

 especially if they're close together„ÄÇSo this is an example of a run chart that you're running across the calendars„ÄÇ

 it's like a control chartÔºå but it's across the calendar and we have a trend in this instance„ÄÇ

All rightÔºå so those are some charts you should be familiar with„ÄÇ

 a lot of charts when it comes to quality control„ÄÇOur control quality„ÄÇ

 as we'll call it for your exam„ÄÇAll rightÔºå great jobÔºå keep moving forward„ÄÇ

 I'll see you in the next lecture„ÄÇ
