In the last lecture， we looked at a cause and effect chart， also known as a fishbone chart or。

I know you said it right in ishiikawa chart。So let's look at some other charts。

 you'll need to know for your exam， a flow chart will illustrate the flow of a process through a system like order in。

 order out or how you go about procurement， so it's how do you flow through that system。

A process flowchar， you don't have to limit this to just our project management activities。

 so it could be how do you choose a vendor in your organization or how do you deal in schedule an inspector to come out and inspect the work so a flow chart shows how you get to that result。

This is a flow chart， could draw it out on a little napkin， have some loop backs and branching。

 but you probably are going to use something like Visio or some other tools to show all the possible routes to the end result。

 so that's just a flow chart just how you flow through a system。

A control chart is typically used in operations where we have repetitive activities like manufacturing or a call center。

So it's a way to track results of a batch or a population that we measure the defects or in compliance of each one of those batches。

 so we' at the we're going to look at a control chart now。Within a control chart。

 some characteristics here， the specs that we're going to see in a moment on the next slide here。

 the specs are established by customer requirements， those metrics that we talked about up front。

Within the customer requirements， we have upper control limits and lower control limits。

 so that's kind of the worst and the best that we expect to do。

The upper control limits is typically plus or minus3 sigma， so you could say plus3 sigma or6 sigma。

You don't have to fall in love with these sigma values。 just know the greater the sigma。

 the tinier the amount of errors there are。So don't worry about those too much for your exam。

 I just put these in here for an example， you can see plus or minus one sigma。

 we're talking about 68%。Plus or minus-2， you're talking about 95% and then 99。73 and then six sigma。

 99。99%。Okay， so those are our sigma values， this ties into our control chart。

 those percentages we're talking about accuracy and defects。So here's the scenario。

 so here's a control chart and this is a scenario I always use。

 it's very easy for us all to grasp we have a project to improve upon a service and the service is a call center。

The customer said out of1000 phone calls， you need to answer at least 980 of those correctly。

So our upper spec is  a0， we could answer a0 out of a0 correctly。

Our upper control limit is the goal of 980， that's our control where we should be is 980。

 that's our target。Now the lower spec， the customer says you have to。

 you must answer at least 950 correctly， so our lower spec is 950。

 and then we have our lower control limit， which would be we're going to back off of that we can do the math。

 but I'm going to say it's 970。The mean is where we expect the results to be。 So in this example。

 our upper control limit is 9，80， and our lower control limit， we said， was 9，70。

 So we'll take the mean right in the average of 975。

Each peak in valley in the results of our measurement here， that green line going up and down。

 that represents a thousand phone calls， so that first one we answered at about 973。

 so we're still within our control limits。And then we go up and maybe we answer 977。

 still in control， and then back down a little， and then we peak up。

 we had a whole bunch of easy calls， so we were up around 983。Technically， that 983。

 that one that peaks up above our upper control limit， is considered out of control。

Then you can see a little bit more action and then look we have a big dip。

 maybe there was a big problem on the network or there was a virus or who knows。

 but there was a big problem and we got a lot of phone calls all at once and we only answered about 940 and then it took a dip and we only answered about 935。

That's also out of control。 and that is an assignable cause。

 We went below our lower specifications here， so that's an assignable cause。

The next term to know here is the rule of 7。 And it's also an assignable cause。

 Whenever we have the results of 7 measurements in a row on one side of the mean， above or below。

 That's a trend。 There's something happening there。 So it's 7 in a row on one side of that mean。

 So in this example， you know， we're like 9，73，974，971。

 We're not kicking across that mean 7 in a row。 That's non random。 That's the rule of 7。

So that's a control chart。It's a trend that we've identified there。All right， good job。

 know these different charts for your exam。
